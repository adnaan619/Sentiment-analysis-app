      "Review 7955: Come undone will be a difficult movie to review as each person will interept the film differently; not in the single dimensional, linear \"connect-the-dot style\" in Hollywood of boy meets boy, boy falls in love with boy, conflect occurs, conflect resolved (or not) end of story. Come undone is rather a single story with three different timelines and the film unfoldes between the three. In my reviewes, I don't like to give away to much of the plot, and spoil the film for others, but it is a love story between Mathieu (the lead character) and Cedric (a real hottie) set in present day France. Mathieu's mother gave birth to a son with cancer and died after birth and the mother's health never fully recovers. His sister has issues too of her own and Mathieu's relationship with her is strained at best. Mathieu finds a release from his disfuctional family in his relationship with Cedric, but Mathieu seems to suffer from a bipolar-affective disorder, thus the mood swings (least thats my interpitation) and explains the hospital scenes.\n",
      "The film jumps from one  timeline to another which makes the movie unique, you don't know which scene is next and nothing is predictible as opposed to the holloywood style where you can predict \" who's going to get murderd next\"; or \" who's going to win in the end \";etc. At times I found myself wanting to cry as this film seemed so realistic and lifelike and I had this surreal experience that I was there observing this in 3D with the two main characters (there is no score or background music)The acting was superb; and the love making scenes didn't look like something out of a cheap porn movie;(ok lighten up so I've seen one or two in my lifetime) so real it could bring tears to your eyes. A film that you will want to watch time and time again, and a must in any serious gay film collectors library\n",

The power brush works well, producing adequate power and the The Crest Complete toothpaste has a nice, fresh flavor.  The Scope mouthwash is nice and the floss is strong and easy to use due to its flat construction. Ultimately, you probably achieve no better results using a power brush unless it induces you to use it longer or if the user has limited or impaired mobility which prevents or hinders using a traditional \"manual\" toothbrush.\n",

So I decided to give it a try.\n",

I've had to reapply it a few times after checking the results (eg, scratchy volume after application to the volume pot) before I felt it had sufficiently cleaned the item. With DeOxit, it stays \"wet\" longer and you work the pot/slider thru its run multiple times to allow the cleaner to fully coat the surfaces to deoxidize (is that a word?).\n",

First, the blending container is a bit difficult to clean thoroughly due to its shape. A more ergonomically designed container would make cleanup much easier. Second, I've noticed that the blender struggles a bit with very hard ingredients like ice cubes or frozen fruit. Perhaps a stronger motor or sharper blades would help. Overall, I'm happy with the product, but addressing these issues would make it even better. Thanks for considering my feedback!\"\n",

Then I checked the specifications and ordered the correct one based on the measurements. It fits perfectly! So I highly recommend that you not guess, but actually measure for accuracy. I know its a pain but its the only way you will get the correct size. It  requires 2 people to properly fit it on the mattress and the quality looks & feels great.

      "- I recently decided to take a different approach to my optics on a Ruger 10/22 that I built. I switched from a heavy bull barrel and thumbhole stock to a Hogue overmolded stock and Tactical Solutions lightweight aluminum barrel. My 3-9x40 RimFire scope from Nikon was a little out of place on the smaller, lighter rifle so I began researching red dots. I currently use an UltraDot on my Ruger 22/45 pistol and I love it. I didn't have the cash for another one so I started looking for something in the sub-$100 range. This optic came up time and time again as being a solid performer with a great price to performance ratio. Please note that I am not comparing this optic directly to the UltraDot (which cost about twice as much), but I am using the UltraDot as a benchmark for my expectations of what I think a quality red dot optic should be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon receiving this optic, I was immediately pleased with the build quality of the optic. It has a smooth matte finish with just a slight amount of texture. The knobs are sized well for easy manipulation. The caps on the elevation and windage adjustments fit securely and the slotted controls click into place with good detents. They're slightly mushier than those on my UltraDot and also on my Nikon RimFire Scope, but for the amount of money I paid, they are definitely acceptable and create positive feedback. The rings supplied are of good quality. In my opinion, they're slightly oversized for this optic and I don't care for the left/right split rings as they make mounting and alignment a little tricky, but they're certainly usable. I've got a replacement set on order and will swap them out when they come in. This is not as much a negative as it is a preference so I don't count against Bushnell for this. The reticle selector switch and the rheostat for controlling both the color and brightness of the reticle both click firmly and have good, solid detents. The included lens shade and polarizing filter are good to have, although I didn't use either on my outing with the optic, but plan to keep at least the polarizing filter in my bag for bright days.\n",
      "\n",
      "The optic itself is clear and bright. There is no magnification, but the glass gives me a bright, glare-free picture. The red reticles showed up well on the 4 and 5 setting when out shooting on a bright, clear day. The smallest dot is the hardest to see, but it is the most precise. The next dot up shows up very well as do the crosshairs and the circle/dot reticle. While I find the smallest dot to be the most precise, I love the circle/dot reticle for plinking. It's bright and still allows some precision. The green reticles are extremely hard to see in bright daylight. Trying them out in my home, I find the green to be pleasing to the eye and less fatiguing (red tends to glare pretty badly in low light situations). If I was going to be shooting at an indoor range or maybe at dusk, I'd probably switch over to the green. Otherwise, I'll stick with the red. I found no issues with the brightness or with glare. I also found that the point of aim didn't change by much when changing reticles. I wasn't shooting from a rest for all of my shooting so I can't say for sure, but for plinking at the range and shooting tin cans, you can switch reticles at will and you'll be on target for anything larger than a quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found the build quality of this optic more than adequate. I also found the operability and quality of the electronics to be of acceptable quality. At half the price of my UltraDot, it definitely has significantly more value. I would rate this optic as one with a 50% higher price point. I personally don't mind a larger optic on a pistol, but for some, it might be too large so I would recommend this for lightweight rifles or an AR-style .22 rifle. I've seen reports of people using this on .223, 5.56 and .308 rifles, but I'll be limiting my use of this optic to the .22 cartridge. I have no reason to believe this optic wouldn't hold up to the repeated abuse from a larger caliber centerfire rifle, but I won't be testing it. Bushnell claims that it will work with shotguns as well as centerfire rifles.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're looking for a sub-$100 optic, look no further. If you think you don't need the multi-reticle optic with dual colors, you might consider the version with just the red dot. I actually didn't see that one until after I ordered this one. I'm happy regardless but you may prefer something a little more limited in function. If you're doing any all-weather or desert run-and-gun competition, I'd suggest something a little more robust. But for kicking around at the local range or the family farm, this would compliment a .22LR build nicely.\n",

      "- I am converted and will never use regular salt ever again (well maybe just for icy patches on the walkway)!!!  There is such a big difference to me now, and a fresh sun warm perfectly ripe juicy garden tomato with this salt sprinkled on,  while eating it like an apple... has taken my taste buds to a soaring new level of YUM.

      "- My brother-in-law is a member of the top 100 wine collectors in the world, so he is extremely hard to buy for (since he is also a multi-millionaire and I am not). He auctioned off the wines he was no longer interested in for $13 million at Sotheby's several years ago, to give you an idea of his level of expertise. I gave this to him for Xmas 2015 and held my breath, waiting for him to toss it aside as un-useful. He actually liked it, and commented that it was very smart to have something that could chill reds, and that not many people knew that could be an issue. Thank you, Corkcicle, for making something that was a hit with a wine expert who is hard to buy for....\n",

Do not expect to not do a little more work than a traditional washer. However, as a college student and mom in an apartment, this is great. I do a quick load of clothes and hang them on a drying rack. The whole process of washing takes around 20 minutes between washing and spinning. When I couldn't get the spinner right, the seller quickly returned my email with suggestions. I've had this a few days and so far, I do not regret buying it. I use a 5 gallon bucket to fill it faster than the included hose. I also use liquid soap and seriously when I say you need very little, I mean it. I use about two tablespoons of Purex or Tide and sometimes I reuse the water if it isn't too dirty. Anyway, I don't hate the machine now. You won't regret purchasing it.\n",

      "\n",
      "The manual itself is very useful, and there are enough English words on the rice cooker so you can easily figure out what you are doing. There is, I'll admit, a learning curve, but that is not because of the language, but rather because there are so many things this rice cooker can do. I've never seen a kitchen appliance with so many options! They are all useful options, mind you, like how sweet vs how soft you want your rice or autoclean mode or whether you want to turn the voice off or how loud you want the volume to be during the night (so the rice cooker won't make noise and wake someone up).  The manual is very helpful in regards to finding out how to do what you are aiming to do. And once you get the basics down, it is quite easy to figure out how to do everything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are loads of things to love about this rice cooker, but I'll stick to my top 3: the resultant rice itself, the delay timer, keep warm setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "I eat a hybrid American/Japanese diet. It's a bit hard to explain, but suffice to say I have rice 2-3 times a day. I'm very picky about my rice. Previous rice cookers I've owned have been nice and all, but never gave me that perfect rice I'd get when I sought out a traditional Asian restaurant. To my utter amazement, this rice cooker can make restaurant quality rice just the way I like it. Within its many options for sweet vs soft rice, it has a setting that perfectly suits what I like. Since purchasing this rice cooker, my rice intake pretty much doubled. Before this rice cooker, I was eating rice maybe one to two meals 3 - 5 days a week. Of course the quality of the rice purchased plays a big part, but I'd been eating Tamanishiki and Sukoyaka Genmai for quite some time, and this rice cooker made a huge difference in the taste and consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also love the delay timer. This rice cooker has a built in clock. So, when you use the delay timer, you don't have to count how far in the future you want your rice to cook, and you aren't limited to multiples of an hour or half an hour. You can manually set the exact time you want the rice to start cooking in this Cuckoo. And you can set it in increments of 10 minutes. This is great because (going into the keep warm setting reason) previously, when I needed my rice done at a certain time, I'd have to \"catch it\" as soon as it finished so I could fluff it and get it out of the rice cooker because the keep warm setting on previous rice cookers would mess it up. This was pretty frustrating because I'd need my rice done so I could take it with me for lunch, so I had to set it the night before. And because I couldn't set it for a specific time, I had to be there for when it beeped that it was finished (and hopefully I didn't count the hours incorrectly). I don't have that problem with the Cuckoo because the timer is convenient and the keep warm setting is fantastic. They advertise that you can keep the rice on keep warm for up to 12 hours, so each night I put in enough rice and water in the Cuckoo and set it to start cooking about half an hour before we get up so the next morning I'll have enough for the entire day. My whole family takes what they want to eat from the cooker throughout the day and I clean the rice cooker and fill it up with rice and water again that night for the subsequent day. It is so convenient and the rice stays fresh and delicious for that whole 12 hours.\n",

      "I'll end by saying I've come to like hearing my Cuckoo greet me in Korean every time I turn it on. I've even learned a few Korean words. Despite my initial frustration at not being able to understand, Korean is a beautiful language, and hearing the Cuckoo speak to me kinda grew on me.\n",

      "- Review: A classic, even a masterpiece for some. Yet its story isn't much different from scores of MGM musicals of the 1930s and '40s: boy meets girl, a romance blossoms, they bicker, they make up. Interspersed would be musical numbers. So it is in this movie, only the musical numbers are ballet sequences, and at the end the girl dies.\n",

      "Moira Shearer plays the ballerina, and Anton Walbrook and Marius Goring are the two men who fall in love with her. Walbrook is the head of the dance company, a man who believes a dancer's life is all dance, and Goring is a composer, a man with principles who wants to do things his own way. Shearer is caught in the middle: she loves Goring (in fact, marries him)but wants to dance, too, for Walbrook. As in the Hans Christian Anderson story on which it's based, she puts on her red ballerina shoes and dances to her death.\n",
      "\n",
      "What makes the movie so appealing to many is its sincerity, along with a good, well-written script and excellent acting. The 20-minute ballet that Shearer performs as the climax of the picture is bold and captivating, and she seems literally to be on fire at both ends with her flaming red hair and the red shoes. (Merle Oberon was slotted to get the role.) Still considered the best dance movie ever filmed by many film-goers. Definitely worth a watch. (Score: ['0.857', '0.074', '0.055', '0.002', '0.002'])\n",

      "- Review: Decent weighted fabric; little heavier than t-shirt material on sleeves and even thicker thru middle. Adorable, unique design. I purposely ordered larger than I needed (for an 18 mo old) - we put leggings on her with this shirt and rolled up the sleeves. Very cute shirt, or in her case, mini dress :) Everything seems sewn on well and it's held up to several washes without shrinking or fading (washed cold, gentle cycle, inside out). They call it a butterfly shirt, but I purchased because of the owl, which is much more prominent on the shirt. (Score: ['0.784', '0.169', '0.031', '0.003', '0.002'])\n",

      "Review: Worth every penny! My first Road Bike, and I love it, the frame built, the look the feel...I hesitated to buy it from amazon, when you ask most bikers they tell you to go to your local bike shop, especially if you don't know your size. I went to the bike shop with a tight budget I could barley afford aluminum frame bikes, the good thing is I was able to get them to size me... but end up not buying the bike selection they had, the one was a giant and the other was a trek 1.somthing, not sure why they are so darn expensive, and they were aluminum, the carbon fiber where out of reach at the shop, so I found a website called bikesdirect, almost got Motobecane Grand Record with carbon fork only but didn't have the shimano 105, by selecting better components the price tag got higher and higher,...\n",

      "Make sure you get a bike fitting, either yourself of at the bike shop. I started the assembly myself and did the bulk part, but I realized that it was more complicated than I thought it would, so I had to take it to a bike shop, to get things tuned correctly. Keep in mind that it doesn't come with a step by step assembly instructions, an other reason to consider taking it to a bike shop for a professional tuning, especially if you're new to this.\n",

      "Review: The Crucible Hot Handle Holder XL is a slightly larger alternative to Lodge's Hot Handle Holder. It is about about 6.5 inches long, 2 inches wide at its widest and 1.5 inches wide at its narrowest. Like the Lodge version, it features internal ribs on both the top and bottom that runs the entire length of the handle and features a hole on one side to hang it up. And like the Lodge version, it shares very similar pros and cons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "1. It works. I boiled water on my 12\" Lodge cast iron pan until it was too hot handle. I then slipped on this hot handle holder and was able to pick up and hold the pan indefinitely.\n",
      "2. You can leave it on cast iron pans when you cook over a stove top. If you're like me, you've forgotten that you're working on cast iron a few times and grabbed a hot handle without pot holders. Burning yourself just once may be enough reason to fork over a few bucks for one of these. But please understand that silicone insulates heat to a certain extent before it turns hot as well. That means you can't leave this (or any) silicone pot holder on when you put your pan in the oven.\n",
      "3. The pot holder is one-size-fits-all and can fit all my cast iron pans, including my generic cast iron 6\", 8\" and 10\" pans that have shorter handles, my 10\" Lodge square grill pan and my 12\" lightweight cast iron Tramontina plan with long steel handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. The inch closest to the flame can get REALLY hot. During my test, the heat that flows over the side of the pan made the handle holder hot enough to burn myself. This problem plagues the Lodge version as well, as you'll notice plenty of burned/melted Lodge hot handle holders on its product page. To avoid burning yourself, pull the hot handle holder about an inch off the handle when its on the stove top. When you need to grab the handle, just tap it back on. It's loose enough to do this easily.\n",
      "2. It's extra large, so it does not offer a snug fit on the handles. This seems to be a big concern to a lot of reviewers, but it leads me to believe many people are just holding their cast iron pans wrong. You should not grab cast iron pans with your palm facing up, which would cause the heavy pan to pivot at your pointer finger and require you to counterbalance the entire weight of the pan using only your weak pinky and ring finger. This, indeed, would require you to grasp the handle tightly, which an XL handle holder would prohibit. Instead, grab the pan overhand (like you're holding onto a cane). Again, the pan pivots on your pointer finger, but the weight is counterbalanced by your entire palm. You don't need to squeeze the handle holder this way.\n",
      "3. The neck of the holder is narrow so that it takes some effort to get the holder on/off Lodge pans. That means if you start cooking without the handle on, you have to push and wiggle the handle holder to work it on. This is not an issue on my generic cast iron pans.\n",
      "4. It's a one-function item, good only for handles. Silicone pot holders can hold other hot items, like pots and bowls, can be used at trivets and can be used to get a grip when twisting lids off tough jars. But you knew this already.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, this hot handle holder provides decent heat protection against a hot cast iron handle and stacks up favorably to the Lodge version, but shares several of the same shortcomings. You can work around many of these shortcomings easily enough.\n",

      "Review: The Forbidden Room,\" directed by Canadian Guy Maddin, is characterized by references to silent cinema, odd use of color, multiple layers of plot, and surrealistic images. Extremely dense and hard to fathom, its nearly two-hours is a tough cinematic experience, particularly for those unfamiliar with Maddins earlier films and offbeat style.\n",
      "\n",
      "The film opens with a prologue in which a dressing-gown-clad narrator (Louis Negin) provides instructions on how to take a bath, the bathwater representing the ocean. The film then switches to the crew of a doomed submarine eating pancakes in a desperate attempt to breathe the oxygen within them. Inexplicably, a lost woodsman wanders into their company and tells of escaping from a fierce clan of cave dwellers. From this point, Maddin and co-director Evan Johnson take us high into the air, around the world, and into a series of dreamscapes, offering tales of amnesia, captivity, deception, murder, skeleton women, and vampire bananas. Like an onion, the film is made up of multiple layers of imagery and story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though initially fascinating, the movie soon wears thin because its virtually impossible to follow any single thread of a story. As a much shorter, experimental film, The Forbidden Room might have been more sustainable, but as a feature, its extreme obscurity makes it seem like a vanity project for Maddin. The movie distances viewers rather than drawing them in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include audio commentary with Guy Maddin and Evan Johnson; Once a Chicken, a seance with Lazslo Moholy-Nagy; and a booklet with essays.\n",

      "Review: George Lucas provides with an excellent ending to an excellent film series in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. After two lackluster prequels, Lucas finishes the series off with a bang with a film bursting at the seams with special effects. The movie has minor problems, such as the actual dialogue and acting, but these are minor because people go to see Star Wars for the effects, and not the dialogue.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Hayden Christensen returns as Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight filled with fear and frustration. Anakin can't understand why he isn't as powerful as he should be. This, coupled with his recurrent dreams of his wife Padme (played by Natalie Portman) dying, ultimately leads Anakin to his fate. Ewan McGregor gives the film's best performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin's mentor who is concerned about his lust for power. Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has the same effect on Anakin as Obi-Wan, but turning him to the dark side.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Watching Anakin turn evil was truly a cinematic event, the viewer's heart breaking along with his as he commits deed after deed, becoming fully seduced by the dark side. Hayden Christensen gives a lackluster performance, at least until Anakin goes evil, where Christensen seems to shine. Natalie Portman is pretty bad too, but not as bad as the painful dialogue. When Anakin and Padme discuss their love, my stomach was churning. Especially at the part when Anakin says to his love, \"You look so beautiful\". Padme responds with \"That's because I'm so in love\". It isn't that bad until Anakin comes back with \"No, it's because I'm so in love with you\".\n",
      "\n",
      "  But all that aside, let's get to the effects. From the opening space battle to the final duel, this movie is laced with them. And might I add, the Anakin vs. Obi-Wan lightsaber duel is one of the best fight sequences I have ever seen. And that's not a spoiler, becuase they tell you about it in the preview. But seriously, it is excellent. The switching of settings, accompanied by Obi-Wan talking to him after, makes for an excellent fight. And, once again, McGregor really shines in this fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "  So, if you are debating whether or not to see Episode Three, I say see it. It provides an excellent ending to an excellent legacy. The critics who love acting and dialogue might complain, but thats not what we go to Star Wars for. It has an emotional impact as great as the original trilogy, while tying everything together nicely. 4 stars out of 5.\n",

      "Review: I was amazed and pleased with series 1, especially how close it followed the book. I base this review on the first 4 episodes of series 2. As others have already pointed out that HBO  took some liberties with the source material and added scenes that were not even mentioned  in the book and changed some characters completely mostly to titillate the audience. It is still a great show, however I wish they would stay true to the original story. I just reread the 2nd book again and it is pretty clear in my memory. (SPOILER AHEAD) - nowhere in the book do you find any mention that Lord Renly is gay. Nowhere in the book is any description that Joffrey (as evil as he may be)tortures 2 naked prostitutes - one apparently to death. Arya's escape with the assistance of the black brother does not come to a sudden halt by being captured (and most of them killed) at their first rest stop, as a matter of fact they beat the Lanister's knights back and NOBODY was killed - what happens later is another story. And there are more of these inconsistencies just in the first 4 airings of series 2. The story also gets a bit ahead of itself and I have to agree that viewers who did not read the books might find it confusing to figure out the new characters, which where not already introduced in series 1, since there is no explanation of relationships, different houses, loyalties to one or the other, etc., which might become clear later, but by then a few uninitiated viewers might very well have given up trying to figure it out.\n",
      "All in all I enjoy the series so far - just hope they do not get too far away from the original story - which happened with \"True Blood\", which is not recognizable any more in relationship to the books and frankly is getting just awful after a promising start.\n",

      "The whole operation set up is different with many preset buttons which seem annoying, but let's stop complaining and try them out.  The learning curve is short and fast, we figured them out in minutes just by trying.  First we tried toasting a croissant straight out of the fridge, push the croissant button, set it at slightly darker (2.5 minutes) by pushing the darker/lighter button.  Wow, it is done so fast and browned exactly right, 100% hot inside out.  That was very impressive, so fast and perfect result, tasted great, far superior than the old reliable toaster oven.  Then we tried others, almost instantly the kitchen is filled out amazing smell of bakery.\n",

      "This is by far the best toaster oven we have ever used, there seems to be no problem with the interior space, holds a lot more than look. This is a keeper, a great buy.

      "Ernest Shackleton was what we would call a free spirit today, and independent, determined man obsessed with reaching the South Pole shortly after the turn of the twentieth century. He managed to assemble a polar expedition with an utterly unresistable advertisement for hard, determined men with the caveat that survival was no guarantee. He secured the vessel Endurance and set out shortly after the outbreak of World War I with a crew of similarly independent minded individuals. His experiences on earlier failed expeditions taught him how he was to manage such a crew, and little did he know how much that experience was going to come into play.\n",
      "\n",
      "After leaving the whaling station at South Georgia at the end of the known earth, his wooden ship stood due south toward Antarctica where it eventually encountered ice floes in the Weddell Sea. As the ship drew nearer to the continent, the ice thickened and the ship bacame ice bound and unable to move in any direction. Repeated attempts to free the ship were futile as the ship was about 100 miles from the coastline of Antarctica.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story becomes one of a race for survival when the ship was slowly crushed in the ice and sank. Everything salvagable was carried off the ship before it sank, but what was left was pitifully little. Worse, the now ice-bound crew and captain were completely at the mercy of the ocean currents which drew them further from land and toward a very uncertain fate where the ice begins to break up. Shackelford's leadership and resolve kept the crew together and under discipline despite an aborted attempt at mutiny. Rations were soon reduced to almost exclusively seal meat. The plight of the expedition grew more and more grim.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the inevitable edge of the ice pack was reached, the men had no choice but to take to the two boats left from the sunken Endurance. No sooner had the boats taken to the ocean when fierce storms enveloped the crew in the boats making their lives even more miserable if that was possible. Several alternate destinations were discussed, the most promising being a place where supplies had been cached, but the condition of the men and the boats demanded making landfall at the nearest possible place. That turned out to be Elephant Island, a rocky outcrop on the edge of the Weddell Sea with no vegetation of any kind. Now a real sense of desperation set in among the crew that was already malnourished and weakened physically. Shackelton was determined to save his crew at any cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the boats was rigged for open ocean navigation and Shackelton and three others set out for New Georgia several hundred miles away across what has to be the worst stretch of ocean anyone could imagine. Howling gales and mountainous waves made the voyage one of complete misery, yet miraculously, the boat reached South Georgia. Imagine a pitiful group of men if there ever was one, and then imagine the realization that they had landed on the wrong side of the island from the whaling station and faced a trek over a 10,000 foot mountain range to get there. Shackelton left two of the men behind and left with one other to make what has to be one of the most remarkable climbs of all time. Shackelton and his companion crossed the mountains and staggered into the whaling station to safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Shackelton had to organize a rescue effort for not only his remaining crew on Elephant Island, but his other two men on the other side of New Georgia. All this took time, but he rescued the two first, the took a tug boat to Elephant Island to rescue any survivors. In one of the epic survival tales of all time, he found all of his crew still alive and rescued them.\n",

      "Liam Neeson could not have been a better choice to narrate this film which featured several movie clips and many still photos of the expedition.

Germany from the West, Soviets from the East. As a rssult of Poland's defeat at that time, more than 10,000 Polish Army officers fell into Sovit hands.

As Ms Dove lays in her hospital bed, steely willed and dry eyed she reflects on her life, the choices she made and in flashback scenes we see the good she has done for her students and town by her personnel integrity and willingness to sacrifice self in interest of the commom good. And the townsfolk respond to her illness in a way that is as improbale as it is uplifting - that Ms Dove is revered and beloved but they are just then realizing this !!\n",

I made a 1/8 in plate out of some plastic I had and drilled large holes where the side mount terminals go.  Then I glued on some inner tube rubber on both side - with the  top side covering the holes and the Bottom Sides open so the plate dropped over the terminals and went out to the edge of the bottom battery allowing the weight to go off the side terminals and allow the trays to sit level.  We also put an extra nut under the top tray to help support the upper battery weight some rather than having the top strap clamping down on both batteries.  Basically we clamp down the upper plate against the bottom battery to the pressure we want and then back the nuts up from the bottom against upper the plate locking it n place.

The Stinger is the perfect alternative. It fits wonderfully on a keychain, is light as a feather and fits fine in a pocket. It is also very comfortable in the hand, lining up perfectly in a fist. Though I've not had to apply it in a self-defense situation (thank goodness), I have no doubt of its abilities. I have tested the Stinger against a tree, a wood beam and even a brick wall. The result? No damage whatsoever and my hand was unscathed in each instance. Try doing that with a fist!!! Oh, and by the way, I have training in the martial arts of Kenpo, Shorin-ryu, Taekwondo and combatives, so I know the proper way to hit. Yet I feel much, much more capable with one of these gems in my hand. My plan is to purchase more of these for the members of my family. I don't know why more people don't carry these.

      "Review: Amazon reviews often amaze me. One fellow gives this clock a one star rating because it does not remain lit 24 hours a day - which is by design and likely a positive attribute for most purchasers.  Another complains the alarm is not loud enough to wake the dead from slumber. Another says it is too expensive, as though the price had somehow been concealed from him when he made the purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cut to the chase. Here, in a nutshell, is this clock. It is small -- about an inch and a half tall, the front face is four inches across, and the unit is about two and a half inches deep. It weighs a few ounces and fits easily in your hand. It has a grippy, matt exterior surface available in numerous colors. The deep blue is appealing and it looks just right next to the red, yellow and anthracite Sottsass 'enorme' phone on my nightstand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operation is simple, and simply explained in many languages in the package insert. You insert the included aaa batteries. With the word 'off' on top, the alarm function is off... Imagine that. In that orientation, you push the 'set' button on the back and then use the hour button (which has a + and a - function) and the minutes button (also with + and -function) to set the time.  There is also an option to display time in 12 hour or 24 hour format. If you touch the top of the clock around the spot that is labeled 'light,' the digital display shines brightly for about five seconds. Otherwise it is dim but readable. Flip the clock over and it says 'on' in big letters. That activates the alarm. The alarm setting displays in the lower right hand corner. You use the same set, hour and minute buttons to set the alarm when the clock is in this position. When the alarm sounds, you can touch the top of the clock to snooze awhile before the alarm will sound again. Or you can flip it over to say 'off' on top and thus disarm the alarm.  During the night, if you touch the top of the clock, the light goes on so you can read the time in the dark. Then it goes off again so you won't have a bright led display shining next to your bed all night long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow.  That was really challenging, wasn't it?\n",
      "\n",
      "The alarm is, to my ears, almost annoyingly loud. Granted, I am a light sleeper, but it does not fail to rouse me from slumber. If you are really unable to wake to this alarm, you might consider erecting a bell tower atop your home and hire Charles Laughton to ring the chimes each day, perhaps yelling 'sanctuary' as he yanks the cord on each chime. A brass band complete with tympani and crashing cymbals also might do the trick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expensive?  That's all in the eye of the beholder. The price is displayed when you make the purchase. If the price seems to be more than you want to spend for a small digital alarm clock, then don't buy it! If you deem that a fair amount to pay for a cleverly designed, minimalist alarm clock, then this may be something you want to buy. I am happy that I bought it, and assuming it continues to work for a reasonable length of time, will continue to find it a five star item.\n",

As LEDs became affordable, many adapters appeared that required removal of the ballasts and that is very tricky.  Many reviewers complained the bulbs didn't work, but it was because people didn't read and understand the bulbs weren't compatible unless the ballast was removed.  These Hyperikon bulbs don't require removal of the ballast.  All you do is plug them in.  This was my first order and they worked exactly as described.  They are a little difficult to install because they are \"top heavy\" due to components inside the bulb.  But, they are much better than the stupid CFLs that didn't provide light until they warmed up and you were ready to leave the room.  And...these use less power and last longer.\n",

      "Review: We were using the kitchen aid ice cream maker freezer bowl that had to be frozen 24hrs in advance & only 1 batch could be made. Even though it worked really well it was inconvenient. We spent 2 months researching compressor ice cream makers & reading A LOT of reviews before settling on this one, & Im really glad we did. We have had it for about 3 weeks, made about 15 batches (6 batches back to back) & it has worked flawlessly. Its SO easy to use, its not nearly as loud as the kitchen aid stand mixer & very easy to clean. A couple of things I noticed after reading hundreds of reviews about this machine was...\n",
      " 1) some of the 1 reviews was due to DOA (dead on arrival),  it happens. Send it back get a new one.  and 2) a lot of the 1 reviews were due to user error. For instance, filling the bowl too full creating over flow & complaining about how hard it was to clean. There is no reason to fill it so full when you have the capability to make multiple batches! 3) The capacity. Its not as large as some other options out there but who cares! Make a 2nd batch. So there you have it, I very highly recommend this machine & I recommend purchasing the 3yr protection plan that Amazon offers for $30. If anything goes wrong in 3yrs, send it back.\n",

I wasn't fastening it tight enough and it kept slipping off my head.  After watching a video by ShariRose on YouTube, I found out that I didn't have it tight enough.  So, the other day I wore it with my scarf, and it stayed on perfectly all day!  It stayed on perfect through a nap, and changing the accent scarf that night...not a single slip!

      "Review: We bought two of these, they worked well at first but lately they are missing a lot.  I think because they are PIR technology they are not working well in the heat.  They were great up at our camp when it was cooler, but we tried them in 80+ temps with 60% humidity last weekend after realizing we had missed pictures (we know people had been there).  We tested over a couple of hours and they were not picking us up even if we waited until reset and were waving around within 15 feet of the units.  For areas where we don't have a lot of motion, I'm going to get non PIR cameras.  Not sure if anyone else has had this problem.  They worked great when it was cooler, even in the cold Maine Winter and the quality was great including the night shots!  Moving up to 4 stars after it helped us to catch deer poachers on our posted property.  Got a great daylight shot of the tags on the truck.  I'm not going to post the pics, but it also showed them coming back at night to throw the deer in the truck!  Unfortunately, couldn't see the tags on the pick up at night b/c of glare, but what they've told the warden and the limited faces we could get (grainy at night) it's going to be a tough one to talk out of.  Going to try the 14 MP one and hope to see much improved.  PIR I think will still be an issue in the heat tho, so will get another 'summer' camera most likely.\n",

      "Review: It works, and it's cute. However, the app is kinda difficult to use, you have to leave the device you're attaching to it in bluetooth range at all times for it to work, and whenever you leave bluetooth range, when you come back you have to restart the device before it will connect again. (So I can't set it up on my phone, because when I walk to the kitchen and back everything has to be restarted. I'd set it up on my tablet, but the Mesh app won't install on it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Also the device is battery powered and requires being charged: this isn't useful in cases where you have an application you want to run all the time. Like, I wanted it to monitor the temperature in my apartment and tell me when the temp drops so I can see to the furnace, which needs its boiler filled from time to time. (This was easy to set up: just set temperature ranges on the Mesh trigger and have it play a sound on my phone when it goes out of the temperature range.) This won't happen every day so the device will sit there doing nothing often, but I have to recharge its battery regularly. It ends up being more work to keep the Mesh trigger charged and connected to my device than to just walk to the basement and check the furnace daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I'd say the Mesh tags are an interesting concept, but that they're more toys than really useful devices at this point. Great for a smart kid to play with several and figure out nifty things to do with them, but useless for real world applications.\n",

Therefore, I had to contact the company via email. They responded quickly and sent a new set of all of the screws (even though I only requested the set-screws). Also, I want to point out that both of the bars have a little more \"give\" than I would like even when everything is correctly tightened. Specifically, in the picture, you'll notice there are two brackets which install into the drywall/stud, which then have pieces that drop straight down into which the long towel bar/rod itself is placed. These two brackets can easily be wobbled side to side about a quarter inch each. I believe it was designed this way purposefully so that the glass has less pressure placed on it over time and use, but I'm not the biggest fan. Overall, it's ok.

      "Review: I've always used cotton balls in Vaseline for wet fire starting but decided to give these a try on a trip backcountry camping up in Banff, where it was pretty rainy and wet.  I've heard of the esbit cooking system, but have never had any experience with it.  So it was a little shocking when I opened one of these little babies up...it smells like 50 pounds of rotting fish in the trunk of an old Buick parked in the sun.  It is REALLY strong.  I ended up cutting a few flakes off to get it started (completely unnecessary..you can just light it while still holding the brick).  My knife smelled like fish for the remainder of the trip. Functionally, they worked great.  One cube surrounded by rocks got a small Ti pot of water almost to a boil and it burned long enough to get a fire going, even with wet kindling.  Overall, since I have a box of them I'll probably bring 1 or 2 out next time to see if I can get better performance out of the little fish bombs, with my windscreen and trying them divided, but once I run out will probably go back to vasi-cotton balls due to packability and smell.\n",

      "I had this before with the first volume of this set in that it's no secret that WWE has had poor revisionist history when it comes to WCW in the past but WWE did a good job in this series spending time on subjects that haven't been talked in as much depth before & were very fair in their discussion on each subject including criticism of their own product & acknowledging their own mistakes with there being better selections for Blu-Ray extras that didn't come off as nothing special & haven't been released in it's entirety before. I have the some of the same criticisms as the first volume in regards to the presentation (once again ignoring the fact that this is another set in regards to WCW that has no representation of the company on the DVD cover) that WWE attempted to stretch this series out so they included episodes on certain people that came off as a reduced one hour version of previous documentaries.  In the end though, I enjoyed the series on the network & the bonus of Eric Bischoff actually contributing to this set with his views & opinions afterwords is a great bonus so this would be a good one to add to the collection right next to volume one.\n",

She carries the movie, very well, thank you, in virtually every scene and through numerous fight scenes.  It is believable and throughly involving.  It's a mystery/thriller, a spy movie, and a super action-packed roller-coaster ride of great entertainment.  Very watchable, and well worth the money to buy and watch again and again.

      "\n",
      "I did a lot of research before buying this pack frame. I have been wanting to get back into long hikes and camping in remote locations. I have a camelback internal frame assault pack style bag. While it is quite roomy and robust on organization,  is not an external frame bag.  And while it suited well for living out of for a day or two at a time in a vehicle or being shuffled around by uncle sam,  it is not suited for log hikes with a heavy load.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I turned to the wonderful world of online opinions and was soon drooling over the FILBE  they are giving to the Marines these days but damn,  they cat a big bag of shiney nickels.  And that's used.  Without the punches.  Or the frame! And sometimes no straps..Just the main pack.  Might even be riped and full of holes.  I was able to find a new one for about $400 shipped.  I know it's worth it but I have KIDS and HOBBIES so that just won't do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I was looking at the MOLLE II system and I like that a lot as well.  But wish it had as much molle webbing as the filbe does. I like options.  It's the red blooded American in me that wants the freedom to make choices and then to later make different choices.  The FILBE has a ton of molle webbing to give me that freedom of choice and just seems to leave the MOLLE II wanting for me and I cant find a molle ii cheap enough to justify the purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I found a really good deal on milsurp alice packs and ordered one.  Man what a bummer.  The frame was unsatisfactory due to wear in ways I felt would make it not last lomg for me. I returned the first and got a replacement in just as bad a shape. So I have to say milsirp alice packs are a gamble and I like to know I am geting what I pay for. But I still need a good camping pack.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I kept looking for new alice packs and on ebay good deals on FILBE packs and I inevitably came across a hellcat for sale. Whats a hellcat? A hellcat is an allice pack modified with molle shoulder straps.\n",

      "But it gets better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enter my hellcat alice pack Mike's edition. I have added the enhanced molle ii shoulder straps and kidney belt to the gen VI molle ii frame. I intend to put a large alice pack on it but the vendor for the rucksack sent me a medium instead of a large and I have no intention of limiting the scope of the completed pack to light loads. I will also be adding  a sleep system pack under the ruck as well as becro side staps fpr walkimg poles amd other gear to long to be packed inside. So going small is not the direction I will ne taking.\n",
      "\n",
      "My philosophy is it's easier to carry less than the bag can hold than to try and fhure out how to carry more than it can hold. So why limit yourself to less than you can personally carry.  Just because the bag can hold more does not mean you have to stuff it full.  It's nice to have some extra room for  unplanned situations. And I love the 6 pockets on the back of the large alice rucksack.  3 larger along the bottom and 3 smaller along the top under the rain flap. These are great for organizing your gear giving you lots of options for ready access to items you don't want to dig for. If the pack is for someone unable to shoulder heavy loads and you don't want the extra real estate then a meduim alice rucksack might be beter suited for them. You still get 3 roomy pockets along the bottom amd the pack could carry enough gear for a day or two in the wilderness. But even then I still recomend this MOLLE II pack frame, and while you're at it the enhanved should straps and kydney belt. They are VERY comfortable. You specifically want a generation four (IV)  because it is the newest and is a lot more durable over time and will be less likely to brake from falling or dropping while loaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I have just my frame  and  straps waiting  for a sutable ruck to come in (Large,  NOT SMALL,  the one with all six pockets on the back.) I decided  to test the versatility of this pack frame by lashing a 50 cal ammo can full of ammo to the frame  and shouldering it. I then walked  around  my property with it fpr awhile and climbed up amd down some stairs.  Pictures attached to show the lashing. I used maybe ten to fifteen feet of paracord I had lyimg around.  Startimg center top I went down the sides amd pulld the handle in to the fram then crossed the can to anchor the bottom and cross the fromt again to snjg it all up at the top.  Thismwas a heavy load and took some grit timhet it shouldered. But this fra, e carried it well.  The high mounted load stabalizing straps pull the frame up tignt to, yoir shoulder to het yiur center of gravity back close to center amd eliminate any sway in the load that would wear yiu down really fast.  The enhanced shoulder straps with they sternum strap also snuged theimgs up and in conjunction with the kydney belt I. was anle tomtrek about uo and down stairs with little effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I have to conclude that this frame is good to go even without habing am actual pack to mount yet. If you can shoulder the weight,  this packframe,  in conjunction with a good suspemsion system will eas the burden significantly.\n",

I was able to get this installed on my granite countertop, but the outlet hose + nut was literally resting against the collar securing nut (it must have had just enough threads for the seal inside the flex hose to squeeze against the end of the threaded pipe).  I suppose in worst case scenario (if their granite was too thick or the nut+hose didn't seal before it contacted the collar securing nut) one could remove the securing nut for the collar and put the right amount of washers in place of it so that the nut for the hose would also serve as the securing nut for the collar.

      "Review: Works great so far.  We had an electrician install this in our light switch that controls an outdoor motion sensor light  on our garage.  Our master bedroom is on the second floor and we don't have a way to turn a light on in our backyard so now I use the clicker light switch that comes with this product to turn the light on from our bedroom.  The wireless signal distance appears very good currently.  I was going to use a lutron Device for this purpose however the lutron wireless remote needs a battery and this one does not. The acegoo uses a kinetic click switch which does not require a battery ( The round main device does need to be wired into the light switch for power). Also this acegoo device has a better temperature rating for low temperature operation.  I installed this in our garage which is not heated and I live in Minnesota and temperatures obviously go way below zero.  One tip during installation: make sure to do the pairing after it is wired into the switch but before you actually finish putting the light switch back together. It is fairly simple and just follow the instructions. It involves pressing a button on the back of the round device.\n",

It is BIG and WIDE compared to my old one. This has turned out to be very helpful. I recently moved and have used it frequently to press items such as linen drapery panels.

      "Review: Update 8-20-2017  I did my first full filter set that included the reverse osmosis one.  The canister was exceedingly difficult to remove, so much so, that I had to get one of those leather strap style wrenches so one person could hold the unit.  After several tries filled with straining and grunting, it finally came loose\n",
      "\n",
      "Had leaks all over the place on this replacment, unlike the first time and second sets that excluded the reverse osmosis set.  At next full set replacement I will probably replace the entire unit rather than deal with this issue again\n",

      "One thing I have noticed is how much clearer the water is when I boil it in a pan.  I never realized that there is clear and and then there is CLEAR. Also, the PH has moved up to the high 7s which is where you want it. Like some reviewers, had issues with the faucet coming loose. Had to get under sink to re-tighten  the nut and while I did this, I placed a small glob of JB Kwik in the waster where is holds against the bottom of the sink,.  This will insure that nothing wiggles but I will still be able to break it loose.  No leaking issues, and so far so good.  At first filter replacement, I will update again\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it appears to work as advertised and this is only the first full day.  It reads around 19 TDS, (Added same day as review) The of my unfiltered water is around 8-8.5 PH the filtered water is around 6.5-7  hard to tell with the test strips but definitely on the acid side of neutral  The water has a neutral taste, which one would expect.  In order to test, I left the waste water hose loose until it shut off to insure that was working properly.  I drained the tank by letting the unit run until the output was very low, then let it refill.  Only after that second cycle did I drill the hole in the drain and hook the waste water up. It sure gave me a piece of mind to know it was working properly.\n",

      "Overall, satisfied, but I took off two stars due to what I consider a bad design decision. I have included what they included in the kit in the first pic, the second pic is what it should have been  The irony is that both of these are available from their web site\n",
      "\n",
      "In this kit is adapter  It has half inch male threads on one side for the sink, the female threads that go to the supply side are larger, I did not measure but something like 3/4 and you have to screw an adpater into it so it will be back down to 1/2inch on the supply side.  They also provide a rubber washer that goes inside the whole mess.  I think that was the issue for this think was a leaker, and no matter what the heck I did, I could not stop the leak in the area where the 3/4male to 1/2inch female adapter screws in  Using the first pic for reference, it is the shot metal threaded piece on the right.  I went to home depot for some help thinking that I might have damaged the adapter, but apparently there is no such thing as a half inch female metal compression fitting like this that they carry:  Those fittings are normally only found on hoses according to him.  Eventually, we did locate a thicker washer that fit more securely into the adapter and I used plumbrs thread sealer instead of teflon tape  I STRONGLY recommend using that instead of teflon tape.  The grief this adapter caused me took off almost a star by itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than the grief of the adapter was the exceedingly unclear 1 page insert on how to hook up the the device if you had a PH filter on it.  That was the item that sealed the fate.  The picture was not clear, the instructions did not help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than those two items, the filter went together pretty easily.  Like some, I did not get a couple of the hoses in place correctly on the quick connect so I had a couple of leakers easily solve by pushing in on the hose so it was fully seated.  The entire installation would probably take a skilled do it your selfer less than an hour as the only realy work will be under your own sink\n",
      "\n",
      "I would buy the product again, and later, after I get a feel for how this thing holds up, I might give a star back, but I think they can do better on the items I described\n",

When it's done a bell sounds that sounds exactly like a bellhop bell in an old hotel. Fortunately, the oven turns off when the timer is done (some toaster ovens will continue to cook).

      "Review: Unconquered is an absolute delight to watch and the cast can't get any better than it is.  Each of the players in this gorgeous Technicolor period piece, are at the top of their game in every way and there is one huge surprise that awaits you...Boris Karloff is cast as, Guyasuta - Chief of the Senecas!  Whatever role Karloff plays, you can be certain you won't soon forget him! Gary Cooper plays the handsome Capt. Christopher Holden, the beautiful Paulette Goddard is cast as Abby, the Captain's eventual love interest, and the dastardly Howard da Silva is cast as Garth, a filthy, double dealing businessman who holds nothing sacred save money and power.  Character actors are aplenty in this film and we have time in which to enjoy the abilities of the always wonderful Ward Bond, C. Aubrey Smith, Cecil Kellaway, Virginia  Grey, Henry Wilcoxen, Katherine DeMille and others we know.  After the French & Indian wars the Ohio territory is still a wide open and wild space filled with Indians, frontiersmen and settlers.  Abby is an indentured, bonded slave, who has been shipped from England to serve her time.  She is to be sold at auction but is saved from that fate by Capt. Holden who forces an auction on board ship.  Unbeknownst to Abby, Capt. Holden is off to be married as soon as the ship docks and he leaves her paperwork in the hands of the slave master there!  All is quickly re-arranged by Garth, who lost her to Holden at auction since he hadn't enough cash to pay for her on board ship.  He pays off the slave master and instructs him to lose her Freedom papers upon arrival in the New World, after Holden goes ashore.  He is to hand her over to his man, Bone, played by Mike Mazurki, another thoroughly unagreeable and dislikeable character who runs a tavern in the territory!  Garth covets Abby, wants her for his own and will have her no matter what and he tells her that Holden sold her to him without telling her and his promise to free her has been dashed by the sale!  Cecil Kellaway has all but adopted her while on board ship and stays with her, posing as her father and also working t Bones' tavern. Garth is intent on capturing all the Indian fur trade and is married to Chief Guyasuta's daughter, thereby having a huge advantage over any other white man. He fans the flames of hatred and pushes the Indians toward an uprising with the settlers.  Watch as the real adventures begin and Holden discovers the treachery of Garth in his dealings with Abby and Guyasuta. Unfortunately he is hampered by his orders as a soldier but must find a way to uncover the truth and unmask this villain so he can prove to his superiors what is really afoot there.  This film is well worth including in your classic film library so pick up the DVD...you won't be sorry you did!\n",

Looking for a less costly replacement I searched through numerous sites and reviews.  I decided to try the Filtrete brand bags based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews and here is what I found:\n",

      "* Latching into the canister - the bag latches into the canister without any problems.  I have never had a bag come loose.  It is secure and works very well.\n",
      "* Seal on hose - There is a rubber seal that surrounds the hose that is inserted into the bag hole.  This works very well as there is never any dust inside my canister.\n",
      "* Sealing when removing bag - The bag does not seal on its own.  It does have a metallic seal that is supposed to seal, but it does not work very well.  However, when removing the bag the plastic latch can be pulled down to cover the hole if you desire.  For those with allergies this is helpful.  One of my children has allergies and we have never had any problems with this.  She uses the vacuum in her room and she has never had an attack.  It should be noted that on the Miele brand bags I had an issue with their spring loaded closure not working as well.  It did work better than the Filtrete, but failed enough that it is not worth the extra price.  Honestly, it is not worth the extra price even if it never failed.\n",
      "* Filtration - As mentioned above, this bag does a fine job filtering.  My family has never had any issues with allergies while using this bag.  The inside of the canister is never dirty and the interior exhaust filter is hardly dirty at all.  I do replace the interior exhaust filter twice with each box as they include 2 filters with each box.\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend these bags for anybody who does not have money to waste and wants a replacement bag that works as well as the original minus the closure not working as good as the spring loaded Miele brand closure.  I did not find any negatives outside of the iffy metallic closure part.  And given that the Miele brand does have some problems with the spring loaded closure at times it is not a deal breaker.  In the end you get 5 effective bags for half the price or better than 4 bags of the Miele brand.  If money grows on your trees, have at the Miele bags.  If you are like most of us then get the Filtrete brand.\n",

      "Review: I saw \"Manhatten Melodrama\" for the first time last night and I was very favorably impressed.  This movie caught my attention right from the very novel beginning.  We encounter our two male leads as youths on an outing.  One of the child actors is a juvenile Mickey Rooney already displaying his talents.  The scenes we witness are craftily designed to show us just how close a bond these two youths were developing.  We get another series of scenes that let us know the different directions each of them takes toward their adult life.  Naturally these glimpses show us two best friends headed in opposite directions.  One becomes a criminal and the other a District Attorney.  There is a woman who who doesn't so much come between them as serves as a connection between them.  Their paths cross from time to time until a serious crime is committed.  I'll leave the plot there because you probably would have guessed this much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The movie features three big names (plus the up-and-coming Rooney) in Clark Gable, William Powell and Myrna Loy.  Their acting is well done and they have a reasonable supporting cast.  The picture won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and you should be able to tell that the writing IS the outstanding part of this production.  It had plenty of other nominations but this was 1934; the year of \"It Happened One Night\".  The movies moves itself from beyond the standard \"gangster movie\" fare of its' time as it unfolds into a great moral dilemna.  This is all well developed and reaches a powerful and emotional level that you might not have been prepared for despite the movie's title.  At least, that's how it hit me.  I didn't give it the top rating available...but I thought about it.  It is certainly worth a look.\n",

      "Review: 17 Jan 2016.  After seeing the Hateful 8, which I liked very much, I do think Tarantino is making a statement about racism in Django Unchained and failing, at least for me, because the characters and action is too stereotyped.  However, I would raise its rating to 3 stars from 2 stars  because I feel more confident that he is attempting to address the evils of racism in his own way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tarantino has great technical skill, a distinctive style, and he tries to subvert what have become movie cliches by mixing genres.  I like but not love some of his movies, but Django does not work for me.  Slavery is a serious subject.  The effects of it still linger today in the institutional and individual racism we see around us if we only look with eyes that can see.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Tarantino does not shrink from showing the horror of slavery, but the problem is that he does so while satirizing Westerns, a \"spaghetti\" Western in particular, a not so serious genre for most of us and in his usual over-the-top, unrealistic way.  Along the way he pokes fun at the illogic and stereotypical characters in almost all Westerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "  I suppose his point is that revenge Westerns that bring justice to a previously corrupt town are not that different from the stereotypical movies about Seal teams killing Bin Laden.  Maybe his ultra-violence is interrogating the idea that violence can redeem.  Maybe he is asking his white audience whether they can truly root for an African-American slave who justly blows up Candieland (America) .  Maybe he is riffing on Maya Angelou's poem about how a black man will believe a white man is on his side when the white man gives the black man a gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The problem is that Django is still essentially a one-demensional character even if he hesitates before finally committing to his career as a bounty hunter.  The Doctor is too even if he hates slavery and speaks French and German.  Candie is too, and that is the biggest problem.  We hate him like we hate all the stock big bosses in Westerns.  He is not real to us.  He can't be like us, but, of course, the slave owners were like us in having the same basic genetic code and like many of us in being white Americans.  We are not so different as we would like to believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "  This is why I give it two stars.  I would give it only one star, but Tarantino does what he does with his usual great skill.  The actors are compelling albeit in limited roles.  It does seem to be trying to make a statement about slavery and the world today.\n",

Windows Mobile is implemented on this phone in a bit of a blah manner. Palm really did not go out of their way to add any cool features. This 700wx can be held and operated with one hand, but the touch buttons and icons on the touch screen are small, making it hard to hit the right ones the first time. The 700p buttons are 4x larger in phone mode, so it's much easier to use as a phone.\n",

When in a car or outdoors, I find I need to put the speaker next to my ear to catch all of the conversation. Bluetooth Activesync works great. No need to buy an extra travel cable!

Instead, they are redubbing the entire series in english, once again. What's the point? Most of the episodes were already dubbed once before (except for the final season) and were great.

This lamp easily satisfies both requirements.\n",

      "I have it clamped to the middle of the back edge of my desk. The clamp is solid and steady. Thanks to the long swing arms, I am able to have the lamp set up so that the vertical distance from the surface of my desk to the tip of the 14 watt compact fluorescent bulb (60w equivalent) is a little over 2 feet. The bulb is centered over my desk, about 14 inches in from its back edge. This arrangement allows me to have bright, useful illumination for the entire surface of the desk (which is 28\" deep and 64\" wide).\n",

The upper arm and the lamp shade both have a mechanism that allows me to lock them into place so they won't shift, even if I bump into the lamp.\n",

My iphone 5 doesn't seem much slimmer than my 4S once it's bundeld up in this. I have a couple of other cases (I love the Diztronic in black to provide SOME shock protection but still a super-sleek profile) but I wanted to have one case that was a bit more protective and this fits the bill.

      "Review: JANIS JOPLIN: LITTLE GIRL BLUE follows a familiar narrative (also employed in 2015's ANY) of the exceptionally talented female star catapulted into the limelight, who could not handle it, and eventually killed herself accidentally of a heroin overdose at the age of 28.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the familiar ingredients were there; the middle-class upbringing In Port Arthur, Texas, where Joplin became something of a rebel against her rather insular family, and expressed her rebellion by acting in increasingly mannish ways. Although she believed herself to be accepted into a largely male society, she found herself victim of a series of reversals, including being elected the \"ugliest man\" in a group of people in Austin, Texas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually she decamped to San Francisco, where she joined a band (Big Brother) and eventually acquired the recognition she had craved ever since childhood. The narrative followed a predictable live: in the end she became too big for her band, branched out on her own, enjoyed some major successes both in the United States as well as abroad, founded a new band, consolidated her stardom and was just about to embark on exciting new possibilities when death eventually struck her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accompanied by reminiscences from those closest to her, as well as members of her own family, JANIS JOPLIN: LITTLE GIRL BLUE told the story of a phenomenally talented person unable to reconcile personal with professional lives. She could not stand being alone when offstage; and tried to find solace in heroin. It seemed that for all their love of the singer (some of the interviewees started crying as they recalled the tragic sides of her life), no one actively lifted a finger to help her psychologically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accompanied by extensive footage of her in performance, together with readings from her private letters, Amy J. Berg's documentary had a certain fascination for anyone interested in her music. But for the uninitiated viewer it seemed to be wearyingly predictable.\n",

To shine  a bit of light on an otherwise dismal existence as it may.\n",
      "Loach's  characters are never overly redemptive: they don't hit the lottery; aren't  left millions by a dead aunt; or marry a rich suitor. And the ending here  is a bit short, trite. But they usually come through the film a little  stronger having weathered their travails, feeling a little better about  themselves. I dare say we come through feeling a little better about  ourselves as well.\n",

      "Review: I enjoyed \"Marie Antoinette\" a lot more than I thought I would. The film begins with Marie (Kirsten Dunst), the Austrian Archduchess, setting off to France to marry Louis-Auguste (Jason Schwartzman). Unfortunately, Marie's new husband has little interest in her or in the act of consummating their marriage, so the future queen finds herself in limbo for quite some time, as it is uncertain whether she will produce an heir to the throne and thus survive at court. Eventually Louis-Auguste comes around, and Marie gives birth to a daughter, and later a son. In the meantime, Marie becomes known as the Queen of Excesses, spending copious amounts of money on clothing and jewels instead of bothering to become acquainted with the issues of relevance to the French people. Marie enjoys parties, sweets, and even an illicit affair, but the fun comes crashing down when the monarchy falls out of favor with the citizens of France, who angrily storm the castle in an attempt on Marie's life. Eventually the royal family is forced to flee their home and go into hiding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, the best thing about this movie is the way it looks on screen. Watching \"Marie Antoinette\" is like stepping into a high-end bakery and admiring a bunch of scrumptious, frilly wedding cakes. Everything about the film is absolutely beautiful: the costumes, the shoes, the palaces, the desserts. However, the dialogue in the first half of the movie is very choppy and sparse, so the only thing for the audience to do is admire all the visual beauty. After a while the script does manage to turn itself around, and I think the second half of the movie is much better in terms of storyline and character development. \"Marie Antoinette\" has a fabulous soundtrack that consists of mostly punk music, which is a lot of fun. Also, the cast is excellent. I was impressed with all the performances, especially Dunst's. She portrays Marie as a naive, frivolous, but not entirely unsympathetic person. I thought she did a really good job.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was surprised that the film ended so abruptly and did not take us to the end of Marie's life. I think the story could have wrapped up a lot better than it did. All in all, though, \"Marie Antoinette\" isn't great, but it's very good.\n",

      "Review: I bought this to replace my long-standing EDC knife of 2 years, a Kershaw RJII. I wanted a plain edge blade with improved steel, no dramatic changes in the edge like the Kershaw's tanto point, and a handle 0.45 inches thick or slimmer for easy pocket carry. I never thought Spyderco knives looked very appealing because of the shape, but this fit the bill of what I was looking for and had lots of good reviews so I threw caution to the wind and ordered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "While all the things above are true in the \"pros\" column, there are some cons that I think are unacceptable for a $70 EDC knife. For one, the knife came really stiff. It was difficult to open one handed. I figured it would loosen up with use, so I opened and closed it hundreds of times over a couple days. It did get easier, but then I started to notice a lot of blade play. With the knife closed, I could push the blade tip to one side of the handle and it would stay there, then I would push it to the other side. It was that loose with side-to-side wiggle. I got a wrench and tightened the screw, which solved the blade play, but then the knife was really slow and tough to open again. So that's my choice, and I don't think I should have to choose between ease of opening and sturdy alignment on a knife this expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing that was disappointing was the clip. The paint started chipping off it from normal wear within a week. Just sitting in an office chair and getting up throughout the day, nothing extreme. It's also not deep carry, and getting a replacement or deep carry clip from Spyderco is $26...just for the pocket clip.\n",
      "\n",
      "It did come very sharp and the steel is good, but considering this is Asian made and you can get an Asian made Kershaw for $20 that is just as functional of an EDC knife, I think this should be about $40, and I would advise budget-minded shoppers to consider other options. If you decide to get it, keep the box so you can sell it if you choose, because there are many fake, convincing Spyderco knives around now and smart buyers will want to check the box/tags. Also, the knife got a lot easier to open when I put a zip tie on the outside of the hole in the blade, as a makeshift thumb stud. You can search for videos on how to do this on Youtube, but most of them explain a version that deploys the blade as you pull it out of your pocket, which doesn't really work if you carry the knife clipped to your back pocket like me.\n",
      "\n",
      "A month after I got the Delica, I got a Kershaw Shuffle, and it's been my EDC since. The Delica is definitely better, but at $16 with a pry-bar pommel, the Kershaw is very thin, useful and charming, and I can afford for it to get lost or damaged, plus it comes with a deep carry clip with a black wash finish that doesn't look as bad when it gets scratched. Different animals, though!\n",

      "Review: The Immigrant somehow fell through the cracks this awards season. And that's a shame, because you'll be hard spent to find a more beautifully filmed or excellently acted period drama this year! The Immigrant tells the story of Ewa Cybulski (Marion Cotillard), a Polish immigrant who comes to America in the 20's with her sister Magda. Magda has tuberculosis, and the sisters are separated. Coming to Ewa's rescue is the seemingly charming Bruno (Joaquin Phoenix), a mysterious man with an odious job.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Immigrant might sound depressing, and it's certainly not upbeat. It's not fast-paced either, but a calm and slow look into the lives of good people who fall into misfortune. At the center of the film is the beautiful Marion Cotillard, with another subtle and powerful performance that continues her winning streak of movies. In the wings are Joaquin Phoenix, daring and brilliant as ever, and Jeremy Renner, playing the closest thing this film has to a nice guy in Orlando the Magician.\n",
      "\n",
      "When coupled with the great Darius Khondij's (Amour, Midnight in Paris) rich, warm, and lavish cinematography, sumptuous costumes, and a period-real recreation of the bustling, dirty, grey streets of New York, The Immigrant becomes both technically superb and emotionally satisfying. If you're looking for a well-acted film with subtle characters, realistic plots, and moving drama, try The Immigrant. 4 out of 5 immigrants!\n",

      "Review: Never could get iFit to work properly. Finally gave up and just used the lame TDF workouts and manual workouts. Eleven months after purchase, the incline/decline motor died. Check the internet - I'm not the only one that had this problem, which, incidentally, has continued from the first generation bike into the second generation. A friend who can fix anything took the motor apart. The mechanical functions were fine - it was the electric motor that died - and now needs replacement.\n",

      "ProForm (ICON Fitness) has such terrible customer service that I would rather buy the motor outright than have to deal with them. I had purchased a top of the line ProForm treadmill at the same time I got the TDF bike (our winters are long). The treadmill arrived damaged and it took months for them to schedule a pickup. Six months later, ICON sent me another treadmill. What go delivered was the same damaged treadmill I had returned six months previously. I could tell because the pallet was broken and the treadmill had crashed down on the control panel, breaking the panel and forking the frame. Unbelievable. It took another six months and a complaint and subsequent investigation with the Better Business Bureau before my money was refunded.\n",

      "Review: Quality product that is well constructed and attractive in design.  Unit comes with accessory mounting clips which I cemented in place to ease installation.  A full spring mounting mounting kit is included.  Add an inch in each direction to accomodate the width of the fan shroud mounting clips.  Fan housing also has holes to mount directly to a surface thereby reducing the width.  Fan comes configured to PULL air.  Remove one nut and flip over the steel reinforced fan blade and then use the Black wire as positive and you have a PUSHER.  Easy..easy..easy.  I installed two fans on my Ford Explorer to supplement the A/C cooling at idle.  The dash cooling drops off as engine goes to idle because the engine driven fan plunges from 3000 rpm to 500 rpm.  Living in Florida, the A/C is used year round so if you drive in traffic at any time, or cool it down with remote start as I do, these two fans maintain the cooling level.  I pulled the Ford manual and located the A/C trigger wire and connected my 4-wire fan relay to THE wire that activates the entire A/C circuit, rather than just the compressor.  This can be done with a Scotch Clip as the connection is only used to TRIGGER the relay and carries virtually no current.  I wanted the fans to operate continuously when the A/C was activated on the dash. Each 7 inch fan pushes 500 cfm and is more reliable than a single larger fan, and easier to package. Mount them high on the A/C evaporator as the gas enters at the top and cools and condenses as it falls to the bottom of the condensor.  Current draw appears to be a mere 4 amps per fan.  I extended my wiring with heat shrink butt connectors and ran each fan through a 10 amp line fuse in case one fails. I taped the wiring to make a factory quality loom installation that is abrasion proof and impervious to water. Very pleased with the results.\n",

      "\n",
      "Young Jim Hawkins (the late Bobby Driscoll, who appeared in \"The Fighting Sullivans,\" \"Song of the South,\" \"So Dear to My Heart,\" and was the voice of Peter Pan in the Disney classic) encounters pirate Captain Billy Bones.  Bones is an imposing figure, and yet he is kind to Jim Hawkins.  Soon, other, more vicious and threatening, characters appear on the scene, all looking for Billy Bones' treasure map, which is now in the possession of Jim Hawkins.  One of those of these characters is Long John Silver (the late Robert Newton, who also played Mr. Fix in the epic 1950's classic \"Around the World in 80 Days\").\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim Hawkins is now caught up in a series of events over which he initially has little control.  A group of men decide to pursue the treasure shown on the map, and they decide to take Jim Hawkins aboard as a cabin boy.  Jim is our observer throughout this tale, and we see many of the events that transpire through his eyes.  Thus, we gain knowledge of an impending mutiny and come to realize how vicious the pirates masquerading as crewmembers are.\n",
      "\n",
      "The excitement and action increase when the pirates mutiny and everyone searches for the treasure.  Jim comes into his own as he realizes that he is the one person in a position to make thing happen, if he only dares.  Though Disney modified many things from Stevenson's story in this adaptation, Jim Hawkins' coming of age story remains relatively intact.  We also learn why Long John Silver is beloved by all who have seen this classic as we see his vicious side and the care and concern he has for Jim Hawkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember seeing this story decades ago as a young child.  The violence in the movie (though there is minimal blood) seemed normal for a pirate movie.  I also thought little of the drinking and smoking that occurred throughout the movie.  Watching the movie as a parent, I was a little surprised at the violence, drinking and smoking that occur in this movie, but I also realize that I survived seeing all those things and, more importantly, I remember my enjoyment of the movie as a child; i.e., for those of you who think children should be protected from these images, get a life.  Pirates drank, were violent and smoked.  Disney managed to keep the rough stuff to a level that achieves a PG rating.  If you object to drinking, smoking and violence in real life, then use this story to help explain why we do not do those things.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do consider this movie a family movie, in spite of my comments above.  You may wish to wait until the youngest in the family is 7 or 8 years old, just so that you can explain the effects of alcohol and smoking and that life in that era was very different from our life today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disney's version of \"Treasure Island\" is a grand classic.  The movie does mute some of Stevenson's morality tale and does remove much of Stevenson's characterizations.  These changes were necessary to adapt Stevenson's classic to a 96 minute film.  In spite of those changes, \"Treasure Island\" survives as a marvelous coming-of-age story that is both entertaining and inspirational.  My children loved this movie when they were in elementary school and I suspect yours will too.\n",

During the making of the movie, when Joaquin Phoenix was making the rounds looking disheveled (almost homeless), behaving erratically, and telling everyone he was retiring from acting to pursue a rap career, there were 3 main theories: 1) that he was on drugs 2) that the whole thing was an elaborate hoax and 3) that he had just lost his mind. Upon the film's release, Phoenix and the film's director, his brother-in-law Casey Affleck, chose to reveal that the whole thing was, indeed, a hoax, thereby having audiences see the film knowing for sure that the antics on display weren't authentic.\n",
      "\n",
      "So since the question on everyone's mind was solved before the film's release, how does the film stand without the mystery? Kind of so-so. Unlike Sasha Baran Coen's mockumentaries in which he plays outrageous characters meant to expose cultural hypocrisy, Joaquin Phoenix is just playing a version of himself ... which makes his erratic, self-obsessed, and spacey behavior in the film less riotous than it is just uncomfortable. Don't get me wrong, he gives a brilliant performance, one that satirizes the modern celebrity who is self-important, lacks perspective and self-awareness, and has convinced himself that fame has given him the ability to succeed at anything that tickles his fancy. By pretending to embark on a rap career when he clearly has no talent for rapping, Phoenix is a parody of all the celebrities, especially those famous for not doing much of anything, who \"suddenly\" think they can become musicians, actors, authors, or entrepreneurs without having any training, experience, or skill. It's just that as a whole, for all its subversiveness, the whole thing fails to be particularly engaging. Sensing this, it's almost as if Casey Affleck felt the need to add just enough shock-value stunts to the outing (gratuitous male nudity of Phoenix's assistant, Phoenix doing drugs with hookers, etc.) to keep the audience engaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "So as a subversive satire and showcase for Joaquin Phoenix's acting chops, the film succeeds. Unfortunately, it's only sporadically entertaining. Which is why I'm giving the whole strange, audacious thing 3 stars.\n",

      "Review: This is standard definition video, upscaled to 1080i for Blu-ray. No deception, it says so right on the box. It looks... OK. As good as upscaled SD video is likely to look. You won't be using this disc to show off your HD projection system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The audio is... OK. It's full-range, dynamic, uncompressed DTS-MA audio, but the mix is not great. The drums are consistently a bit too hot; the lead guitar usually buried; lead vocals (particularly Anderson's) a bit too up-front. Not well blended, very dry, very little house sound (audience or room ambiance). Sounds a lot like a sound-board mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "The LPCM 2.0 mix, IMO, fares better, and I think its a different mix, not just a fold-down of the 5.1 version. It's not radically different, just more cohesive.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved the show when I saw it last year in Philadelphia, and this is pretty much the same show from earlier in the tour. Anderson's vocal issues are well-known, and I think his solution -- to include a \"vocal avatar\" in the band to carry part of the load, to act as a visual foil, and add some theatrical dimension to the narrative -- is brilliant.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you listen to recent Anderson recordings, like TaaB2 or the recent Homo Erraticus, his vocal limitations are less evident. He still sounds like himself, and he writes for the voice he has now. You hear what's there, and it sounds fine. It's only when he tries to recreate performances from long ago that it becomes clear how seriously constrained his singing is. Thus, adding the young actor Ryan O'Donnell to the ensemble provides a very acceptable workaround, with the bonus that Anderson can play flute (with undiminished virtuosity) during vocals that were overdubbed in the original, and omitted or handed off to the keyboards during performances during the 70s.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the band does a fine job of being the world's top Jethro Tull cover band during TaaB. These are the first live performances of TaaB2, of course, and I think there's a little more spark in the second half of the show. (As an aside, I was absolutely appalled by the great number of people who abandoned the Philadelphia show at the break. Apparently, they just wanted to hear the familiar, with no interest in the new. Cretins, I say. Philistines.)\n",
      "\n",
      "These shows are fun to watch. Anderson's energy and antics are barely attenuated from his glory days. The multimedia and theatrical elements are worthwhile enhancements. The old music is as compelling as it ever was; the new music is a worthy sequel, original in its own right yet clearly related, that also expands on the original narrative themes in relevant ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever encores may have been performed (they did \"Locomotive Breath\" and one other song in Philly, IIRC) are not included here. But at 114 minutes for the main concert, plus some bonus material, it's a full program. (Interestingly, the bonus material includes additional performances -- at Montreux -- of two of the TaaB2 songs, and these *are* in HD video. Don't watch them before watching the main concert if you don't want to see just how much better the HD looks. The audio mixes -- stereo only -- are better, too, IMO.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: If you caught the tour, you'll want this. If you're a fan but missed the tour, you'll want this. If your main interest in Blu-ray concerts is in great audio and video quality, look elsewhere.\n",

      "Review: I bought a copy of this flik some years back - its' original production/release date was 2001. Always on the 'look-out' for some amusing 'sexploitation' product - I'll have to admit I got sucked in by the title and purported premise of: 'kidnapped strippers being auctioned off as white slaves'. While this 'shot direct to video' effort does sorta deliver what the box art implies - the amateurish quality of pretty much every aspect of it decidedly detracts from what potential enjoyment of the product one might hope for.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 'tone' of the piece is broadly 'satirical' - presenting a Micky Spillaine-like private eye scenario wherein 'the dick' (get it?!) is approached by a woman looking for help in finding her missing cousin - a stripper named Bambi - who has disappeared. This, of course, presents the perfect 'excuse' for the 'dick' (played by Bob 'Gonzo') to visit the strip club and start questioning a variety of half nekkid girls to get information. Ultimately his sleuthing leads him to a local crime king-pin named Romeo who has been kidnapping girls and selling them as sex slaves to wealthy foreign clients, at a 'car auction' . The PI infiltrates the auction and manages to whisk the girls to safety at the last minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "This flik totally looks and feels like a bunch of guys were sitting around in a strip club in Jersey one night and thought to themselves: \"Hey, I bet we could make some money if we could talk the girlz into taking their tops off and hang a little 'white slavery' plot around it. - we'll make it a 'comedy' so no one will take it seriously and all our ineptitude will seem like part of the joke.\" It might almost have worked if it wasn't SO inept that itz painful. Pretty much the only redeeming value is in the T&A component and even that is of questionable quality. Some minor 'adult star power' is provided by the likes of Mia Copia (star of some Seduction Cinema vehicles) - she can barely keep a straight face while delivering her lines - but then, likely, it's not her 'face' that catches your attention. A fair amount of female nudity is on display throughout, but no 'sex scenes' - everything is 'played for laughs', but nothing is really very funny. There are some limp attempts at bondage scenes as the 'slave girls' are paraded about at the 'auction' where they are 'sold' and described as if they were 'cars' - \"check out the headlights on this one\" - Har Har.\n",

      "Review: This was used to soften a new mattress that we went too firm on. It has worked perfectly, saving us from replacing the brand new mattress.  I did not have the chemical odor problem with this that others talked about.  I did let it lie flat and expand for about 3 weeks prior to using it (out of distraction, not because it really *required* 3 weeks - probably a couple days is enough). As others have mentioned, it seems about a half inch short in length or width compared to the underlying mattress, but this is not an issue with respect to comfort; you won't notice.  It only looks aesthetically a little displeasing if you are looking at the mattress with a cover sheet because it will look uneven at the edges.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple observations may help others:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) What is the right thickness to choose?  I pondered whether to go with 1, 2 or 3 inch foam, worried that something too thin would soon wear-in so that we were back to troublesome firmness of the underlying mattress. I got the 2-inch thickness. It turns out to be fine, even slightly a little too thick. In terms of the risk of wear-in, the 2-inch thickness is *plenty*.  If you go any thicker, you might find yourself sinking in, never to be heard from again. I'm even wondering if a slightly thinner version would have sufficed. \"Deep\" bed sheets that had fit our new mattress (itself one of those expensive deeper modern foam layered mattresses) now actually don't quite fit over the combo of this plus the mattress. Bottom line, this foam product has held up and has not \"crushed\" down.\n",
      "\n",
      "2)  This combo of a foam layer and a firm mattress below solved our problems (back problems, sitting up watching TV in bed problems, excessive heat in summer problems). Our prior mattress (an earlier multi-layer foam affair) was soft through and through. If you sat on the edge, the entire mattress would squash to 2/3 of its thickness. This felt luxurious at times, but also in certain postures was bad for the back. It also smothered you in your own captured body heat in summer. And you couldn't leverage yourself out of depth of the mattress. Prop yourself up on your elbow? Nope, your elbow sank deep and you weren't where you thought you'd be. So we replaced it with the new firmer mattress. In our zeal, we avoided a thick foam top layer. That was a mistake, since now we felt bruised at the hips and shoulders. Adding this 2-inch foam topper added just enough cushion and support for hips and shoulders, while providing the deeper resistance for better sleeping posture and leverage. Anyway, just sharing in case it helps anyone else trying to figure out the right balance between softness and firmness. Go for a firm mattress and a 1.5-2 inch foam topper.\n",

One button press sets the HIGH level, and the light is bright and illuminates objects well about 10 feet away. But it's not as bright as other lanterns I've used. The brightness is a 260 Lumen rating. Pressing the On button again sets the LOW level of light. This is near useless since it barely illuminates about 2 feet away. It's only useful if the battery is low.  This unit uses 4 D-cell batteries. With that much power, I expected brighter output. From a lantern it's good.

      "Review: First, let me say two things.  First we LOVE Scooby Doo.  Second, I love this cast and we own Scooby Doo the Mystery Begins.  I had my doubts about Freddie and Shaggy not looking like the cartoon version but we loved the first movie they made.  The first one also bucked the Scooby Doo formula and had real ghosts but over all was great, we loved it.  This one is unfortunately a train wreck love story.  The main reason for this is they totally take out the mystery, it gets very little play time as they break the golden rule of Scooby Doo, there is not the subtle flirting there is dating between Freddie and Daphne; Shaggy is head over heals for Velma.  So you are left with Scooby Doo minus Scooby Doo and a mystery . . . you are left with a boring and annoying love story.  Really too bad as I love the cast.  I hope they wake up and get back to the Scooby Doo formula and make a third one.  If I want a teenage romance, I certainly won't turn to the Scooby gang.  All three of my kids and both adults in our family were really, really bummed as we own everything (really) else that is Scooby.  We will skip this one and hope you will to.  Hope this helps!\n",

Yes, there is a certain appeal to the Martian women's costumes, some of which are so short I'm surprised they got past the censors.  And there are a couple of mildly impressive sets.

      "Review: My 2007 Whirlpool duet dryer had that loud screeching sound that so many others have experienced.  I figured that I might as well replace all these parts since I would have the whole machine apart anyway so, I ordered this kit on Monday, using the free economy shipping option.  Wasn't expecting to receive it so fast but it arrived 2 days later, on Wednesday evening.  I had the dryer back up and running within a couple of hours that night.  Everything was shipped in a single plastic bag, packed in a padded envelope.  I used every piece that was provided - four drum wheels, tensioner pulley, drum belt, 9 Tri rings and a bushing.  I don't know if these were actual Whirlpool parts, the packaging was vague.  But, the quality was as good or better than the parts I removed.  I replaced the four drum wheels, but the old ones seemed to be fine.  The culprit was the tensioner pulley, which had some black plastic residue melted to its bearing surface causing the pulley to seize. It was probably the remains of the original Tri ring, which was missing.  I'm thinking it must have melted, burned up and shredded since the black residue was also spread around the area.  Shop vac took care of the residue and I used a fine abrasive pad to clean the fused plastic off of the bearing shaft.  Im not sur wife it was necessary but, I put a drop of Teflon lube on each bearing surface during assembly.\n",

      "Taking the front of the dryer off and getting it back together was the most challenging part of the job.  Lots of screws, which for the most part, are pretty easy to locate.  The tricky part was getting the top control panel off.  It is permanently attached to the trim ring which goes around the door opening and the whole assembly is fastened to the cabinet with a bunch of hidden spring clips.  Be careful releasing the metal spring clips, they are fused to the trim ring and will break off pretty easily.\n",

Turns out there was a loose wire that was rubbing up against the squirrel cage fan that was causing the buzz.

In return he got a lonely bowl of cereal. My son looked confused and solemnly said, \"No, Dad. I meant breakfast.\". Yeah, my kiddo thinks my house is IHOP and I'm just fine with that.\n",

      "So, when I saw this nifty device I was over the moon. Not only did it mean fast food in my kitchen it also meant that there was a chance my now 9 yr. old could make his own breakfast. We've had the toaster for 2 weeks. Here's what I've found:\n",
      "\n",
      "1)Egg pan: The pan is adequate, although I wish it felt sturdier and was bigger as it feels like a toy. I'm always waiting for my egg to spill out. Although it looks like it can hold only 1 egg it does actually hold 2 eggs for scrambled or poached. As some mentioned, the pan does stick a little but then I don't grease it at all. Honestly it doesn't stick as much as I thought so it's not an issue for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "2)Toaster:\n",
      "-Toaster & Egg Setting: Cold bread/muffins, however, is an issue for me. When I read other reviews complaining about cold toast I rolled my eyes at the whiny babies. A laid back person, such as myself, doesn't boo hoo over lukewarm toast....right? It turns out that cold toast actually does cause me to whine. It's not just that toast isn't warm, it's really a bit cold and the edges feel ultra crispy. With the egg/toast option selected, when the toast is done the toaster turns off but doesn't fully eject the bread. The idea is that the heat from the cooking eggs will keep the toast warm. Sadly, I've found that the egg heat is enough to dry the bread out but not enough to keep it warm. When I finally remove the toast it's quite stiff, has no warm bend to it and the edges have a noticeable brittle, dry crunch.\n",
      "-Toast only: It toasts fine. I have no complaints. I haven't tried toasting bagels yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "3)Cooking Eggs: Hard boiled eggs come out fine, as do hard poached or scrambled. However, soft poached eggs (which I adore) aren't to my liking at all. The eggs pop out hot with a nice yolk. However, once I start eating there are small globs of clear, uncooked egg interspersed (think sunny side). I hate that. I scrape it off and it ruins my poached egg happy zone. (Who's whining now? Me, that's who!). Poaching an egg on the stove-top causes the egg white to delicately cook all around the yolk, leaving NO clear egg slime.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Meat Steam Tray:  This works fine for me. I eat veggie sausage which cooks quickly and has no juices to drip. My husband doesn't like to heat his regular pork sausage in this as he says the sausage drips sausage-water onto his egg. He'd rather just heat the patty in the microwave. When bacon is heated in the steam basket it becomes soft, so we don't use this for bacon. Canadian bacon or ham is really what this steam tray is made for so that is mostly what we use it for.\n",

But after a few years, now I enjoy watching this one usually followed by the sequel. A preacher who makes a living by setting up fake exorcisms arrives on a farm in the depths of southern Louisiana thinks he is earning a quick paycheck only to come face to face with something he himself never truly believed in. Ashley Bell does an excellent job at playing Nell, the girl who is supposedly possessed. I don't want to give away any spoilers but personally, I didn't expect what happened in the end. What I love about this movie now that I've come to appreciate it for what it is, is that the cast does an amazing job in their performances, the score is great & there are plenty of great scares that I enjoyed. There is also a mystery going on here & you don't really know what's real and what's not. Also the setting really draws you in. I love the deep southern, creepy Louisiana feel that this movie has going on. I'm glad that they moved on from the found footage type of film in the sequel which I enjoy even more than this one but this is a fun horror movie with a great cast that you need to see for the origin of the story. Just give it a chance. It's not the best horror movie in the world but it's also not the worst and personally, I don't think this movie deserves all of the hate that's it's gotten among horror fans.\n",

These detectives note Chandler's fastidiousness and expensive tailored suits and fast-track rep and the resentment brims over like a good hot cuppa. The vitriol doesn't come more vicious than from the unit's weathered, abrasive Detective Sergeant Ray Miles (Phil Davis). The tension only mounts when the police continue to be baffled. More corpses surface. Stabbed. Carved up. Mutilated.\n",

      "I don't know what the percentage is, but an element of luck figures into any crime-solving, no matter how proficient the investigator. Luck saunters in in the shape of scholarly \"Ripperologist\" Edward Buchan (Steve Pemberton) who promptly mentions the eerie parallels between the current rash of murders and what Jack the Ripper done so infamously in 1888. DI Chandler politely exhibits a raised eyebrow. DS Miles is even more direct in his scoffing. At first. But, soon after, it reluctantly dawns on the coppers that what they're facing is indeed a savage, devious copycat killer emulating Jack the Ripper's deeds detail for detail. It's pretty horrifying when history like this repeats itself. Jack the Ripper, remember, was never caught.\n",

      "The modern police force versus an ancient villain straight out of urban legend. How can anyone pass this up? WHITECHAPEL's hook seems to be that of our trio of characters being pitted against criminals who've patterned themselves after notorious past killers. And I am down with that. I'm impressed with WHITECHAPEL, with its intelligent writing and staging of atmosphere that isn't quite paranormal but lapping on the shores of. The writers did a seamless job integrating Jack the Ripper's canonical murders into Chandler and company's contemporary investigations.\n",

      "The two lead actors, Rupert Penry-Jones and Phil Davis, are rather brilliant, especially when in scenes together. Their uneasy relationship drives the plot as much as their ongoing case, the fish-out-of-water paper policeman and the battered, angry old bobby what's been forever in the trenches. There's a sense of gratification when DI Chandler - who only ever wanted this case as a stepping stone - begins to develop a taste for the chase. A warm glow suffuses at that moment near the end when Chandler's upper-crust boss informs him ruefully that he'll never rise above the rank of DI, but then take a peek at the expression on Chandler's mug as he reacts. I believe there's a contented smile. Solving the Jack the Ripper case will make a man out of any obsessive-compulsive wimp. Something which probably can't be said if the guy what done it is called Jack the Tickler. Or Jack the Stabby Dude.\n",

Too bad she's forgotten by most, most people don't know her, they find out about her through watching old movies of the 30s and 40s, a lot of people find out about her through Betty Grable, which is ashame because Alice Faye is more talented then Betty, no offense I love Betty Grable but, Alice is talented, it seems sometimes Betty Grable want you to pay attention to her body. Carmen Miranda is great as usual, both of them do good in this movie, no one steals the scene, Carmen Miranda has been known to steal a couple of scenes from Betty Grable But this movie, but Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda are great together, they both are equally talented, this movie is a symbol of why the 40s were so great.\n",

A lot of times when you get a wooden spoon, the 'bowl' or recess is barely enough to hold a measurable amount of liquid - at least that's been my experience.  This spoon has a nice, deep well and the handle is nice and sturdy.  I absolutely love it.  The spoon I received looks slightly different than the spoon pictured (it's thicker), but I'm pleased with that.  What I got was a gorgeous, smooth spoon that I don't worry about breaking if I tap it a little hard to remove excess material.  There was an initial problem with shipping as the first never made it to me (I didn't notice that it was shipping from Jerusalem), but the shipper was kind enough to replace and re-ship once I made them aware of the issue.  I received a lovely email and apology.  Bottom line, great spoon and great service :)\n",

I am a ginger, but not the really pretty kind with porcelain skin. I am usually kind of pink and sometimes splotchy. This oil seems to even it all out and make my skin more like that creamy white I have always wanted. It does not feel like oil when you put it on. It feels more like a gel and it dries very quickly with out any greasy feeling. I received this at a discount for my honest review but will be ordering it again when I get close to running out. The only thing I noticed that I didn't like was that the dropper doesn't suck up very much at one time. I guess that is so you don't use too much, but I have a lot of cleavage to oil up so I may use a different dropper if I can find one that seals well and hasn't had baby Tylenol in it.\n",

I bought these to get me a reasonable priced hinge, but as others have pointed out, there are engineering imperfections that prevent these from working as they should. I will say outright that the frames were straight and plumb and bad cabinets cannot be blamed for these failures, but all the hinges needed everything from little shims to WD40 to get them to \"self close\". It took me more time to adjust and play around then it took to install the hinges on the doors and hang them, making the money I \"saved\" a loser. When I did this full time, I didn't buy cabinet hardware from Amazon. Bottom line, one or 2 hinges are OK but a set for a kitchen, stick with a brand name like Amerock, and not cheap Chinese crap.

I'm not familiar with the comics that this film is supposed to be based on, so I'll look at it as a stand-alone entity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story plods along at a snails pace, but the special effects are pretty good, especially the visions of Hell.  The opening exorcism is one of the best parts of the film.  Although Keanu Reeves catches a lot of grief over his performance in this flick, I think that his acting skills were perfect for this particular story.  Rachel Weisz is also very good in this film.  She tackles a briefly dual role as psychic sisters.  Her character's supposedly Catholic beliefs come into question when she mentions that she doesn't believe in Satan.  That's almost like saying you're a Catholic and you're pro-abortion.  That's two things that just don't go together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Catholicism in this story is treated very lightly.  It's almost as if they just used Christianity as a cool looking backdrop for Constantine to eradicate things in.  The Crucifix-looking gun was rather silly looking, but Constantine did have some other nice weapons in his arsenal.\n",

      "While I won't say that everyone will enjoy this film, I'm sure fans of modest action flicks will enjoy this.  Some Catholics will probably be turned off by the sacrilege and the ability of Satan to do certain things in the film.  However, if you take this flick for what it is worth, which is a popcorn-ish adult action/horror yarn, you'll be sure to enjoy it.\n",

      "Review: \"Scary Movie 3\" offers yet more hit-and-miss comedy in the \"Airplane/Naked Gun/Hot Shots\" vein of movie parody.  As with the previous two films in the \"Scary Movie\" franchise, the writers of this film look towards recent popular horror movies to serve as the basis for both their jokes and their storyline.  In this case, the plot is a cross between \"The Ring\" and \"Signs,\" with a few glancing blows aimed at \"The Others,\" \"The Sixth Sense,\" and, of all things, \"8 Mile,\" along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlie Sheen and Leslie Nielson are probably the most recognizable faces in the movie, both being veterans of earlier \"Airplane,\" \"Naked Gun\" and \"Hot Shots\" films.  As with most films of this type, some of the jokes in \"Scary Movie 3\" work and some do not, but those that do are often quite ingenious and make the movie as a whole worth seeing.  The crudity that marred the previous films in the franchise has been almost completely eliminated here.  Some people may find that a loss while others may find it a gain.  Frankly, I prefer the gentler, more innocent tone in this edition.\n",

It looks like it may have been partially sprayed white and they ran out of paint, or it didn't absorb the color. It's somewhat grey looking, as though it is dirty. We tried cleaning it, but it didn't help. The other drawback was the hinges, or rather, the pre-drilled holes for the hinge screws.

I have been a fan from afar of his appearances in other independent projects like \"The Trouble With Barry\".  Old Dogs and New Tricks is so well turned out it's like a mini version of Sex in the City.  There are some wonderful moments such as when David Pevsner accidently hooks up on line with his friend Curt Bonnem.  And of course Leon Acord (with a fabulous head of hair) leads the fun.  Acord's scenes with his chums and his nemisis played by Hart are hysterical. There is also an obvious and wonderful spoof of a Dynasty water fight that includes Olympian Greg Louganis along with Acord and Hart as well.  Two thumbs up!!\n",

      "Review: At this point, I've gone through over 5 different brands of styluses (styli?, apparently both usages are correct).  Most styli that I've used are good, but they don't quite do the work I want them to.  I've realized since then that the limitation is not with the stylus, but with the way the iPad is set up -- handwriting and drawing just isn't ideal.  At any rate, I feel as if I've gotten a good idea about what constitutes a good stylus and a bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FRIEQ brand stylus is good, and there's one key feature that separates it from the pack of other styli.  If you look at any other brand of stylus, you'll see that they are mostly the same, and they all end in a domed rubber tip.  This FRIEQ stylus is a bit different -- instead of using the conventional rubber tip, it uses a wiry, weaved together material (it sounds course, but it's actually soft and somewhat fuzzy).  The result is that these tips give a little bit less whenever you touch the screen; unlike other styli, this one is very sensitive.  Now, this is both good and bad: if you want a stylus for handwriting/drawing apps, this is a great product to get your hands on.  However, if you just want a stylus to browse the web with on your tablet or phone, I think I would go with the more conventional rubber tipped styli.  I used this product on both iOS and Droid devices and did not noticeable a distinct advantage for either platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "These styluses are currently being priced at $9.95, and I think that's a reasonable price if you're looking for a stylus to write with.  There are plenty of colors to choose from (Pink, Blue, Silver, Black, etc...), so you can pick a stylus that fits your style.  The stylus is a bit thin (it's the same size as a normal ink pen), but there is a nice ridged grip for prolonged use.  I really appreciated the grip -- it's a feature that most styluses seem to forget to include.  If you have bigger hands, you might find the size of this stylus a bit too small.  This is among my favorite styli, but it really depends on what I need it for.  So, the bottom line is, would I recommend this?\n",

      "Review: At first glance, the MagnaCoach (MC) looks like your typical dry-erase basketball clipboard but with designer styling. It has the basketball court diagram imprinted on it with the appearance of a nice wood court. It is made of metal and plastic and has a nice heft to it. Durability will not be an issue with this board. The MC makes good use of its real estate by using the flip side of the board as a roster lineup chart for both teams with room enough for up to 12 players on each team.  It also has a spot where the coach can track timeouts, fouls (by player and for the team) and a section for coaches notes. The board comes with a nice dry-erase pen with a built-in eraser and a magnetic strip so that you can stick it to the board for safe keeping. Unfortunately, the magnet on the pen is very weak and will fall off the board with only a slight jostle. Another feature of the MC is that it comes with 24 magnet strips on which a coach can write player names of both the home and opposing teams. These strips are coated with a dry-erase surface so names can be changed out. These strips are meant for the reverse side of the board to align starting lineups and creating matchups. However, I don't see these strips as being very useful in any practical application.  The only potential benefit they provide is that perhaps the coach won't have to rewrite his own players names each game. Since dry-erase marker is so easy to erase, the names are likely to get wiped away unintentionally anyway. The mobile aspect of the magnets certainly won't be used during a game since the player number and fouls are tracked on the static part of the board and cant be moved along with the magnets having the player names.  Overall, I like the board and its thoughtful layout on front and back. Once I get a stronger magnet for the pen, I will love the ability to stick the pen on the board and not lose it. SKLZ could have dropped the price a bit and left the 24 player magnets out of the kit because they are virtually useless.\n",

Having just watched the excellent 2disc '50 Years on Stage', I went looking for more. This is a superb film (6 discs) and Barenboim's Beethoven is wise and abundant - and the film's not just music. Conversation, breezy cutaways, but always returning to the reason for the season, which is Barenboim's musical maturity and his seeming emergence as a revered elder. In the Master Class segments, Barenboim even manages to get Lang Lang to LISTEN more! Young musicians have a great deal to learn from the maestro in this phase of his musical life: learning to lean on music, to trust it, to set aside ego inside one's work, and how to listen as a musician. These pure qualities this pianist possesses in spades. Absolute recommendation. How many times can you hear these sonatas played with this kind of beautiful authority? Dont even think twice.

I bought these glasses last year and I absolutely love them! They brighten everything and cut the glare of lights so I can drive longer and see better at night.  I can drive almost 2 hours at night now, so shopping trips and family visits are much more frequent.  These glasses have been a blessing and I highly recommend them if you have trouble driving at night.  I am thinking of ordering a backup pair for the glove box, and a separate pair to keep in my husband's truck.\n",

      "So this past summer I went on vacation with my best friend and our families.  Before embarking on our trip, my friend came across these promotional videos for the new Go Pro camera, a camera that basically allows any Joe off the street to become the director of his own movie.  We had to have one.  So, setting off for a beachside vacation with a Go Pro in our pocket (and on our heads and on a stick and basically wherever else we could stick it) we documented our entire trip.  The camera ended up in the ocean, bouncing on six foot waves, for forty minutes as we sloshed around and rammed into each other.  It was attacked by dolphins, wound up in the mouth of an alligator and ended up in my best friends pants.  Watching back these videos can be exhausting.  While they are visually stunning, forty minutes of going in and out of the ocean or ten minutes of barely distinguishable dolphin noses can be called artistic but cant really be called entertaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "The point is that you can hand anyone a Go Pro and they start to think that they are Terrence Malick.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is kind of the feeling I had while watching Leviathan, a film Id been anticipating since early this year when I saw the trailer.  Documentaries are a genre that I have vocally had a hard time embracing.  Last year the only documentary that I saw was Katy Perry: A Piece of Me and the year before that it was only Life in a Day (for the gimmick), despite really wanting to see Pina (it only played by me for like a week and I missed it).  I just don't gravitate towards them and so I tend to miss them all.  I wanted to change all that this year.  With so many documentaries garnering critical praise, I decided that I was going to make a conscious effort to see more of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first ten minutes or so had me experiencing so many different feelings and emotions.  About one minute in, as the screen remained mostly black with just the audible sloshing of water and the brief glimpse of a chain here and there, I was intrigued.  Three minutes in, with barely a change in scenery, I was concerned.  Five minutes in, as the action become clearer (sort of) and I could see men in slicks, soaked to the bone, yanking at machinery, I was almost convinced that this was going to be a masterpiece.  Ten minutes in, when the fish finally fell from their netted imprisonment, I already knew the films problem and it is a problem that remained throughout the entirety.\n",
      "\n",
      "This film really needed a sharper edit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Telling the story of a North Atlantic commercial fishing boat, Leviathan is the anti-documentary.  That is what initially drew me to the film.  As a man who isn't always interested in documentaries, to hear that the filmmakers themselves hate documentaries and set out to create a documentary that felt more like a gritty movie made me really excited.  Forget the fact that I coined the film Bears on a Boat after seeing the trailer (yes, Im that shallow sometimes), I legitimately wanted to see this for more than the five minute shower scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "Debate my sexuality all you want; I don't care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon finishing this film I was left conflicted.  There is so much that I actually admire about the direction that these filmmakers took here, but they are the very same things that I would probably change in order to make the film better.  Its a slippery slope from artistic to unwatchable, and while I applaud the idea and the concept (this is so avant-garde in construction), these choices ultimately bring the film down.\n",
      "\n",
      "With no narration (and really, only a speckle of talking at all, which is barely audible thanks to the white noise emanating from the surroundings), the film feels very cold and detached, which was purposeful and kind of refreshing.  That being said, without any sort of conversation between crew or voice over to illuminate us on what it is that we are experiencing, the abrasiveness of the visuals (and they are abrasive) lose some of their poignancy and impact.  Watching fisherman desecrate the bodies of stingrays for five minutes is already hard enough to look at, but with no real context it feels like unnecessary brutality.  Again, this is probably the whole point and I do admire the idea, but I would have done it differently.  More than the lack of narration though, the films biggest hurdle is the lack of edit.  Each individual scene is probably two minutes too long.  If they had only trimmed these scenes down, the film would have been a 60 minute doc and it would have probably been perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead we are left with elongated scenes that don't change much at all in composition and become repetitive and ultimately burdensome.  For a film that is a brisk hour and a half, I felt like I was watching a four hour movie.\n",
      "\n",
      "And really, don't watch this hung-over.  I almost threw up.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are seeking a unique movie experience, this is your ticket.  The film is unlike anything Ive ever seen, but it is a film that I admired more than I enjoyed, and I really wish that these flaws hadnt been so present, because they overwhelm the film.  I do hope that more people try their hand at this style of filmmaking, because conceptually and visually, the film is not merely compelling but really beautiful, in a disgusting and gritty way.  It just feels so raw and honest and brutal.  This is a film that I won't be forgetting anytime soon, and one that Im sure Ill continue to mull over.\n",
      "\n",
      "I may absolutely LOVE this in a week, once Ive removed myself from the initial experience and given my mind time to soak in the lingering impact.\n",

      "Review: I was looking for another machine to add to my routine and help better train me for triathlons.  I knew nothing about rowing machines.  I did a little research on them and they seem like a great fit and a list of benefits I liked to have.  I decided to listen to the reviews for the concept2 machine and pay the money for this gym quality machine.  I'm guessing I made a right choice since I love this machine.  I'm not sure if I am using it right, but it is a fun work out and I like the definition I am getting from it.  Its a nice fun pull and slide motion, making the workout easier to stay with and longer. I was pleasantly surprised my heart rate monitor hooked (wirelessly) right up to it.  The preloaded programs and games are fun, but the work out alone is what I enjoy.  People say it is a lower leg work out, but I feel it else where.  Maybe I am already accustom to hard leg work outs from spinning.  I look into the proper ways to use the machine and its shaping my upper body quickly.  I did have a problem with assembly, one screw did not thread properly and I was really mad.  I didn't not want to send it back.  I called the Concept2 customer service and it was incredibly friendly and delightful to get my problem resolved.  They allowed me to continue to use the machine until the replacement part came.  I understand that not all products leave the factory floor flawless, but they made sure I was taken care of.  This machine and the company is a five star product and service for sure.  At least, you know you will get a perfect service from them, and that is why I recommend them.\n",

The inside pockets are nice for all those little things you may need to carry like chargers, lens wipes, little lights, etc. I like that this pouch can be mounted on the front of the pack or attached to your pack straps and used as a chest pouch. The molle mounting system seems a little light, but does a good job of attaching the pouch where you want it. there are extra molle channels on the back to allow using tac ties or malice clips if you want to be just extra sure.

I have very small hands, so this size should have been too big for me (small/medium).  I could not fit my hands in these gloves at all.  The weights made it harder to fight to put the gloves on, and I spent about 20 seconds trying to remove it, then hit the \"Return\" button on Amazon.\n",

I don't know of a more tender, sweet love story between two young males than \"BEAUTIFUL THING\". The title says it all. In the face of a cruel world, predjudice society, and family struggles, these two lads find something beautiful and unique, through each other, that they never knew could possibly exist. This is the perfect companion video to \"GET REAL\". Very tastefully done with superb acting talent and a good supporting cast. If you like gay romance, and coming of age films, this one will surely go down as one your very favorites of all time.\n",

      "Review: I bought this scale for calculating my carbs, fiber, fat, calories etc. It is good scale, however, I find the buttons are too small and don't always respond when you touch them, I have chronic pain and some difficulty at times with fine motor skills so this makes a difference to me- larger more sensitive buttons would be much better. I'm usually short of time and I like to do things as quickly and as easy as possible, who doesn't?\n",

      "I also thought typing the food name in would be easier than using a code, but with these buttons it's not.  When you enter the food name, a few variations of that food will come up, you select the one you want next: when I try to press enter to get the information I sometimes have to do it 2-3 times before it seems to work. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong here.\n",
      "\n",
      " The variations on each food are nice but I feel they're limited to a degree i.e.: it has broccoli variations such as raw, boiled, boiled from a can or something like that- but not steamed. It's just those little things that you might expect that aren't there that seem to make it less appealing. There are 1900 listed foods, but it's not possible to scroll through at all as far as I can tell to look at them. You have to type the name in and then the scale gives you what it has- at this point you can use the arrows to scroll through the selections for that particular food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another drawback  is that this scale gave me carb content for foods which DON\"T have carb content as far as I'm aware, such as chicken. I'm diabetic type 1 so I need to know for sure what the carb content is and so do many other people with various dietary restrictions.\n",

      "The on-again-off-again blocks of tight continuity and multi-episode story arcs of the new Doctor Who series has already primed fans for the return of this string of CLASSIC Doctor Who stories and some of the best of Tom Baker's final season as the 4th incarnation of the Timelord. This set comes not only at a peak of the show's popularity, but during the restyling of the shows look (and sound). Producer John-Nathan Turner, retooled, the theme and graphic for the 80's, even the Doctor's threads, JNT introduced his appropriately somber plum gear. This set contains the finest examples of all of those changes, end for the Timelady Romana and K9, also the beginning of the end for the 4th Doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Full Circle\" is the first of this arc featuring not only an introduction E-Space, a smaller universe with a universe, but the Doctor's questionable next companion, Adric. Adric is a sortof smarter-version of the 2nd Doctor's Highlander companion Jamie, crossed with Dickens' \"Artful Dodger.\"  Will Sci-fi writers never learn, the arrogant oversmart teenager is never appealing on screen, just as poor ole' Weasley Crusher. \"Full Circle\" for it's faults contains some great moments for Baker to chew-up the scenery, and some superb costuming, the Marshmen ala' creatures of the Black Lagoon. \"Full Circle\" is a tale of a culture apparently stuck in endless preparations for a \"return home\" with several dark secrets which further delay their journey. Determined to get \"back to the basics\" and have the Doctor solving problems without any quick fixes, the producers planned to remove K9 from the series. Already, opening the season with him exploding in saltwater, the assault on K9 continues having him spend much of this 4 parter with his head off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next story \"State of Decay\" is the best of the three...finally VAMPIRES in the Doctor Who Universe (or in this case an E-Space universe)...The Doctor tells in hoarse whispers how \"every known planet has legends of vampires\" and reads ancient tales of the early Timelords and the war with the Great Vampire and his minions, he reveals how after the bodies were tallied, he remained unaccounted for. Before Steven Moffat's episodes aired, State of Decay was surely the creepiest of the long running series. An ancient rocket, it's fuel tanks filled, not with fuel, but BLOOD!! Hoo, hoo! Genius! An the superb attention to atmosphere in \"the village,\" even Romana's wardrobe to the Hammeresques  trio of kingly vampires...Genius, I say again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the escape from E-Space in \"Warrior's Gate.\" Featuring a strange and interesting use of a virtual environment, while fairly common now was less successful in past attempts when the series worked \"set-less.\"  Here I feel it works well achieving the \"nowhere\" effects (much like the 2nd Doctor's visit to the Land of Fiction), although much of this episode is overcomplicated and artsy. The cat-people make-up, of the Thrails and the neat Gundan robot warriors all add the high-concept effort of this unique story. In some early moments two of the crew of the Slaver ship indulge an homage to \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead\" even including the coin. The story follows a cat-like race that while once cruel masters themselves, are currently in need of liberating, the Doctor's prime hobby.  As always more great dialog, gems like the Doctor's, \"We'll burn that bridge when we come to it.\" and from Romana, \"Astral Jung!\"  The final farewell to Romana and K9 is brief and less moving than many departures in the show's history, although the Doctor assures us that she will be more than just alright...she'll be SUPERB.\n",

Nothing.  Shows like Barnaby Jones had stories, and the people who made the shows knew how to tell the story.\n",
      "  When I was a kid, shows like Barnaby Jones were the grown up shows you loved to be able to stay up to watch.  Now, grown up shows border on the perverse.  In the 70's, my sainted mom and dad took us to visit Cooperstown, New York.  It was a treat to be able to stay up late and watch a show like Barnaby Jones, while nibbling on Chicken in a Bisquet crackers (back then, that was one of the unusual crackers.  Now, there's a million varieties).  Now that my wife bought me the DVD from Amazon, I intend to watch Barnaby Jones, savoring not just the nostalgia, but the quality.  I already have a box of Chicken in a Bisquet crackers to nibble on during the show, and I'm counting on my mom and dad to be looking down and watching with me, from Heaven.\n",

      "Review: I want to review the technology of this product more than anything. Infrared thermometers estimate the temperature of an object by measuring the infrared radiation of an object. So you point this gun at a location (the laser pointer helps you know the exact location) and this gun uses a sensor to measure the thermal radiation coming off the patch of area the gun is pointed at. This device costs about $30, it is a sensor, a laser pointer, display and a processor, don't expect a supreme level of accuracy on a device such as this. Testing it out on a pizza stone on my grill I have compared it with other much more accurate temperature measuring devices and I find it always to be within 5% to 7% of my other thermometers, which in the end isn't bad. Just don't expect a super level of accuracy in a consumer product like this. If is more for convenient temperature measuring then super accurate temperature measuring, especially since once you the farther you get away from the object the less accurate the reading will be, stay within a foot or two at most. If you are okay with that, then this item will work for you. It is simple to operate and use, and built pretty well for the price. If you have any other questions feel free to ask me in the comments.\n",

      "Review: I started with one of the CRKT tools that has the nubby spork on the end. It was also heavy. My fingers would be covered with food trying to reach into a bag, a bowl, you name it. I got tired of that and purchased this folding spork after being satisfied with my previous TOAKS purchases. This is my favorite utensil of all time now. It's so light, if I put it in literally any pocket at all, I forget about it and hours later have to think hard about where I put it since it's so light. It's long enough that you can cut about 3\" off the top of a mountain house and reach the bottom of the bag without getting your fingers gunky. That's fantastic for me.

      "\n",
      "I put it on a Q-size pillow top mattress, so could only go with the 3\" in order for my existing sheets to work, but it is a tremendous improvement.  I am a toss-and-turn, side-only sleeper and was having issues with numbness in my right hand from sleeping half the night on my right side.  (I tore some cartilage and tendons in my right shoulder awhile back from repetitive over-lifting while cleaning up after a hurricane.)  Well, the improvement was noticeable within a few days with it taking a lot of pressure off that shoulder.  The numbness in my hand is nearly gone now.  I wish I could have used the 4\", but didn't want to buy all new sheets ... however, I did buy another of these in the 4\" for my guest room bed that isn't a pillow-top and my friends have told me it is absolutely heaven to sleep on.  So, measure your current mattress and your sheet corner height and if you can go with the 4\" I would do that.  The 3\" is really great, the 4\" is awesome!\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding heat retention, I've found it much cooler than just my existing pillow top with a padded mattress cover.  I live in the extremely hot and humid area near the Gulf Coast of southeast Texas.  I like it cool at night for a better sleep and actually found I could run the A/C 1-2 degrees higher in temp at night and still be comfortable with this topper on my bed.  That might not sound like a big thing, but it actually made a noticeable difference on my electric bills in the \"dog days\" of summer.  Now that's amazing!\n",

      "Regarding the smell other reviewers mentioned, well ... I have a ton of airborne allergies, but I'm not hyper-sensitive to \"chemical\" smells, (Texans on the Gulf Coast are pretty much inoculated to the smell of petrochemicals being in \"Oil Country\"), but I really didn't smell anything noticeable after unpacking either of the toppers I purchased.

So seeing the opportunity to diversify my routine with a well loved artform I was sold. I took ballet for a few years (3 or so) when i was much younger...that's it. So saying that that made it easier for me would be a stretch. What I liked was that the routine seems as though it is easy so you think okay I can try this and then before you know it you are sweating. There is a lot of leg work and that means that it involves using a lot of large muscle groups so it's got to get your heart rate up. I personally don't love voice-overs but this one was not distracting, cues were good and demonstration excellent. I would actually have loved more classical music but that is just by the way.

      "Review: Okay, perhaps I am exaggerating, but Sangster is a marvelously inventive and imaginative screenplay writer.  If not all his history or horror is real, it's also never dull.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three of the films in this set were written by Sangster, and they're on a creative par with the rest of his work. Stories come to the point right away, have plenty of action, and conversations are literate but brief.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite of these four films is Terror of the Tongs.  The story of one man attempting to penetrate a large and well-organized conspiracy of terrorists may not seem too likely, but this film is so well made that any disbelief gets suspended right away. The story is very tight and moves quickly.  Sure, nobody who plays Chinese is actually Chinese, but I don't think any offense was meant. It would be well to remember that this was made in an era when actors like Victor Mature played Native Americans.  (It would be years before the industry began to make smarter  casting choices such as Robert Redford as Denys Finch Hatton in Out of Africa.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The two swashbucklers, Pirates of Blood River and Devil-Ship Pirates, are both highly enjoyable.  There are a few scenes from Blood River that, in composition and color, resemble some of the outstanding N.C. Wyeth or Howard Pyle pirate paintings.  Both films have a great look about them, and a major reason is the presence of Christopher Lee. Whether the part calls for elegant or basic costume, with eye patch or without, Christopher Lee is what pirate captains are supposed to look like.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Stranglers of Bombay is indeed similar to the Pierce Brosnan film The Deceivers, as the other reviewer mentioned.  I do not claim to know anything of terrorist methods other than what I've seen on the news, but if my understanding is correct in even a limited way, then Stranglers of Bombay shows that terrorist tactics of the 19th century have some overlapping with those of the 21st century.  This is another depiction, like Terror of the Tongs, of how one man tries to uncover the secrets of an organization which has thrived on murder, fear, and silence.  For one man to penetrate such a conspiracy may not be quite believable but writer David Z. Goodman (whose writing here is as good as Sangster's) makes a strong case that it could have happened. Of course, budget and dramatic considerations enter into this, but again, it's terrific work by all concerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three films have great color and Stranglers has glorious black and white.\n",

      "Review: Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman play two retired wild west bounty hunters, back in their saddles to chase one last bounty after decades of silence. Agonizingly slow, its two leads take their sweet time collecting their belongings, mounting their horses and trotting at a leisurely pace across state lines, sharing less than a few sentences along the way. We gather that Eastwood was a shady character in his day, reformed by the love of a deceased wife, but he seems more like a caged animal than a redeemed spirit and we're never given much reason to pull for him despite the presumed change of heart. Though his beloved bride's spirit lives on in the couple's two young children, he barely acknowledges their presence before leaving them on their own for a month to randomly hunt a new bounty. Freeman tries to drag some character development out of him on the trail, but Eastwood holds onto it with an icy grip and piercing eyes, and there we sit for the rest of the picture. Gene Hackman is noteworthy for his portrayal of a smarmy, cocky town sheriff with a chip on his shoulder, but on every other count this is a western that misses with each squeeze of the trigger. Despite a few beautiful panoramas, the world feels stiflingly tight and compressed. Outside of Hackman, there's no fire and passion in the cast, even when Eastwood turns the page and transgresses to his wilder young persona. Finally, the atmosphere, crucial to all films of the genre, feels too clean and polished where it should be gritty and dirty. Much as I would have loved to see Clint don that familiar parka and revisit the days of his Sergio Leon sunrise, it's just not happening here.\n",

      "Review: This is a good riflle. It is 100% plastic but it's rugged. I've dropped my several times doing no damage at all.  It  holds 2 co2 containers that are  placed in the magazine. The magazine it's does not detach. It is fixed to the rifle and the lower portion of the magazine comes out to install the co2 cartridges. There is a separate rectangle cartridge that comes out the magazine that holds the pellets in two wheeled holders. There's one on the top and bottom so you can just flip it around and keep shooting. The pellet wheels hold at least 10 pellets each. I've had no issues at all with the seals for the co2 cartridges. I didn't fire for a month and no gas was lost. This rifle has a little bit of a kick to it and it's fairly loud. I was putting holes in a wooden sign attached to a tree from 75 ft easy. As for as accuracy goes you have to adjust the sites. The rear side if fully adjustable with the front site fixed. Amazon sells a rail to add a scope if needed. Theres two clips to apply a sling to it which is a nice feature. The rifle is fairly big, i would say it's to scale of a real M 14. The price wasn't bad that's why I bought it. I've taken out a few rabbits in my garden with it so yes it will kill small varmints. I bagged a rabbit at 40 ft hitting it dead center on the side and the pellet penetrated and spun the rabbit around 360 degrees dropping dead where it stood. I was using regular pellets nothing special. The rifle is worth the price and will get the job done if your bagging small game.\n",

These spring clamps will hold most broom / rake items and many \"over-sized\" handles as well.  They are held on with two screws which are not included but I do not have any issues because screws normally included are too soft.  The clamps have a large spring loaded tab you push on to open the clamp, insert your item and release for a firm hold.  The spring is very strong and has no problems holding large shovels but is too strong for my 9 yo daughter to use easily.  She can open them and remove a broom but it takes her a little time to put a broom back up.  Adults and older kids have no issues.\n",

I had to modify the interior of the helmet in order to make it more comfortable so I used the extra padding that Fox provided and stuffed it on the bump. After that, the helmet performs as it should. It has nice big vent holes near the top so your head gets the cooling that it needs, and there is a space on top of the helmet that is ideal for putting Go-Pro mounts. If this helmet didn't have the bump on the inside, it would of gotten 5 stars... Overall, if you modify the padding on the inside, it turns into a great helmet.\n",

But it has its own merits. The story's good, elaborating on the legend of the giant killer. The effects could have been better, but the producers allowed no extra time or expense, so the stop-motion work was a labor of love.

      "Review: \"Out of the Blue\" is a fascinating documentary about the UFO phenomenon. The team behind the movie support the ETI hypothesis, the notion that UFOs really are space craft from other parts of the universe, manned by intelligent aliens. The documentary features interviews with military personnel, pilots and astronauts who claim to have seen UFOs. The Rendlesham Forest affair is prominently featured. Much of the information in \"Out of the Blue\" comes from previously classified government documents. One UFO case involved a luminous object which disabled 20 nuclear warheads! The Condon Committee report is effectively debunked, and many official \"explanations\" turn out to be quite absurd: swamp gas, light houses, the planet Venus (an old classic)...\n",
      "\n",
      "Somehow, \"Out of the Blue\" restored my belief in UFOs, which I lost when I was about 15 years old...\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are still major problems with the approach taken in the documentary. For instance, the laws of physics seem to suggest that travel faster than the speed of light is impossible. It's also somewhat mysterious why an advanced civilization would take the trouble to come here in the first place? What's their motive? Also, why have the USAF, CIA and NASA covered up so many UFO reports? What's *their* motive?\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the documentary attempts to be as \"respectable\" as possible. It doesn't mention any close encounters with the actual aliens supposedly manning the nuts-and-bolts space craft. Nor does it investigate the myriad of reports about \"alien abductions\". Contactees and UFO cults aren't featured either, despite being a vibrant part of the ufological landscape. If the team behind \"Out of the Blue\" can believe that a UFO has disabled nuclear warheads, or that a UFO landed in a British forest outside a US military base, why don't they believe, say, the Barney and Betty Hill abduction case, George Adamski or Whitley Strieber? This obviously calls for a closer discussion. Also, why don't they believe in a gigantic conspiracy from Roswell to Area 51? I'm not suggesting all these things are real. I'm simply pointing out a weakness in the methodology of the movie. What's their criterion of \"reality\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, I don't think UFOs are literal alien craft. If they are, I have to conclude that alien civilizations are even more stupid than humans! A clear case of evolutionary overspecialization-degeneration... As already noted, the natural laws of physics are pretty well known, and seem to preclude long-distance space travel by purely physical means. As for the illogical, occult and \"religious\" aspects of UFOs, they simply aren't going to go away. Perhaps there is a way to distinguish the occultist aspects from the nuts-and-bolts observations, but I frankly doubt it. As Hilary Evans quipped years ago: \"The last thing a nuts-and-bolts ufologist wants is for monsters to enter the stage. Unfortunately, people have seen too many strange creatures together with UFOs. We simply cannot get rid of the monsters\". (I'm quoting from memory but this was the gist of it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever the explanation for the UFO phenomenon might be, it must somehow incorporate those monsters...\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite that, I will nevertheless give \"Out of the Blue\" five stars. Monsters or not, this documentary at least shows that something *really* strange is going on at this godforsaken planet. Ah, I feel like 14 again!\n",

      "What I dislike most about the 8890 Spectra is the power supply cord.  Previous Norelcos (including my 5821 Reflex)have a simple power cord with no transformer - the transformer is built into the shaver.\n",
      "With the Spectra, Norelco took one giant leep backwards by placing the transformer at the plug end of the cord, and, the prongs do not even fold in like most modern power supplies.  And, it is huge!  The Spectra with its recharging cord take up twice the room in my already stuffed suitcase as my Reflex.  Additionally, the \"Stand\" is a useless piece of cheap plastic - I have thrown mine out.\n",
      "On the plus side; the Spectra gives an excellent shave.  It is very quiet and the floating head design is better than my Reflex.\n",
      "Summary:\n",

We could take all the pictures we wanted and if we hadn't had a car charger, we still would have been able to GPS our way back to our hotel room. We usually wait until our phones are at 11%  before hooking the charger up, they have enough juice to get it back up to 100%. My husband uses his almost daily and charges it at night. It chargers sooooo quick! I had one in my purse for over a week and used it today and it still got my phone back up to 100%. I'm so happy with these!\n",

      "Review: The original Chrysler hose on my van had lasted over 10 years, until it cracked at the connection to the air intake box; it took just over two years for this Dorman part to crack at the same spot. At that time it had not yet cracked all the way through, but I had to wrap electrical tape over the crack and needed to buy a new hose. Please bear in mind that the hose in question runs between the engine, and the intake air box solidly mounted to the body. Therefore, it is subjected to fatigue stress the entire time you operate the vehicle. It appears that the reverse-pseudo-engineers working for Dorman and/or their offshore supplier never took that into consideration. This part is not worth saving couple of bucks (if any) over the Mopar product. The Mopar part number for this application is 4694646.\n",

      "Review: Not only do you need to know that this direct to video movie is a sequel to \"Dracula 2000,\" but that it is now the middle part of a trilogy that concludes this year with \"Dracula III: The Legacy.\"  Otherwise when you get to the \"to be continued\" ending you might feel cheated that you are left hanging just as things are starting to get interesting.  But then for most of \"Dracula II: Ascension\" it is not really clear why this 2003 film is a sequel to what is now the original in all this.\n",
      "\n",
      "In director Patrick Lussier's \"Dracula 2000\" the new twist on the story of Dracula is that we finally learn the real reason why the vampire loathes Christian symbols.  It turns out that Dracula is really Judas Iscariot (you have to admit, it is an audacious idea even if it is rather ludicrous).  However, this great revelation has almost nothing to do with this story except for a few seconds towards the end.  This makes sense because except for Dracula's crisp corpse in the morgue most of this film has no reason to be tied to the first film.  Throughout the important thing is that these characters have stumbled across a real live vampire, so to speak, and the fact that this is the burned body of Dracula is as inconsequential as the idea he is really Judas as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Dracula's body shows up in the morgue and as Elizabeth Blaine (Diane Neal) and Luke (Jason London) do the autopsy they come up with the crazy idea that this is the body of a vampire.  Then something happens to convince them that they are correct in their suspicions, an idea that is reinforced when they suddenly get a phone call out of the blue from a mysterious stranger named Luke (John Light) offering $3 for the body.  Luke is interested in the money, but Elizabeth sees an opportunity for the vampire's blood to save her boyfriend Lowell (Craig Sheffer), who suffers from a degenerative condition.  Lowell brings along a pair of graduate assistants, Kenny (Khary Payton) and Tanya (Brande Roderick, Miss April 2000 for \"Playboy\"), so that the can help investigate the scientific properties of vampire blood and, of course, eventually be the vampire's victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Father Uffizi (Jason Scott Lee), an imposing vampire killer with a bullwhip and a wicked looking scythe, is going around decapitating the undead.  Dracula is next on his hit list, but his superior, Cardinal Siqueros (Roy Scheider) makes a point of telling Uffizi that he should not only be killing vampires but trying to save their souls.  Even though Uffizi is a priest, this idea has never occurred to him before, but you know about the hierarchical structure of the Catholic church, so this will come into play in the film's end game.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of scientists playing Dr. Frankenstein with Dracula has its moments, although of course such efforts are doomed to fail.  At the same time \"Dracula II\" goes back to the ancient Eastern European superstitions that vampires have to untie knots and count scattered seed, a curious juxtaposition with the modern science and Judas elements of the story.  This also sets up some strange comic relief at the film's climactic moment, although I like the idea of which character of this strange little lot shows the most courage and intelligence in the face of a hungry vampire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another addition to the vampire idea Dracula insists that he has had many incarnations.  In addition to Vlad Tepes the names of Gilles de Rais and Caligula are thrown around.  This works with the idea that every time Dracula comes back he looks differently, which explains why the character was played by Gerald Butler in the original, Stephen Billington in this one, and is going to be Rutger Hauer in the finale (you can catch a glimpse of him in a flashforward during the flashbacks).  In other words, what could be an interesting idea with historical resonance, exploiting the whole Judas idea, ends up being an explanation for the casting in this trilogy.\n",

      "There is a lot going on here in this film, although it is a mixed bag of hits and misses (and we have no idea why the title is \"Ascension\").  Lussier filmed both \"Dracula II\" and \"Dracula III\" at the same time, and in the finale Uffizi and a sidekick will travel to war torn Romania (where these movies were filmed) to try and finish off the vampire once and for all.  Perhaps the best thing I can say for this film is that I am interested in seeing how this all plays out.\n",

Bags, rifle case, back packs. All top notch products and perform well beyond my expectations. 5.11 quality has always been top notch. Sadly I have noticed a trend with 5.11 as with many other companies. Their quality of material has begun to decline. I received my 6x10 pouch and immediately noticed the feel of the material felt cheep. Plastic like and not what I was expecting. Compared to my olde 5.11 pouches it felt like a cheep knock off. And then I found it. In plain English \"made in China\". It's a real bummer when you come to respect a company for their quality only to be let down when they change. Sorry 5.11 but you have let me down.\n",

      "Review: This charger is identical to the \"Samsung Galaxy S6 charger\" offered by iRAG, except this one comes with a 3ft microUSB cable rather than a 6ft cable. Otherwise, the adapter itself has identical printing, specs, etc. and is probably made by the same company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this is labeled an LG G3 charger, it has a microUSB interface, so it'll work for anything that uses a microUSB charging port. Another reviewer here mentioned that if you own a Galaxy S5, you'll need a microUSB 3 connector. Actually, it'll charge the same rate using regardless of the connector, as I've tested on my Galaxy S5 with an inline USB ammeter (with both the normal and wider microUSB cables).\n",
      "\n",
      "The device has two USB ports. The top one is labeled \"1A\" and the bottom is labeled \"2.1A\". Naturally, I thought the lower one provides faster charging. But using it to charge up my power bank and measuring both ports with an ammeter, it gives me the exact same readings. In my case, it read 1.8A on both ports, clearly higher than the \"1A\" label. I get the same 1.8A reading using all my 2A chargers, so this works as expected. This seems to confirm other reviewers who identified the same readings on both ports. When using the other port to charge a Samsung Galaxy Note 8, the port I'm measuring drops to 1.6A - still above the \"1A\" rating. I\n",
      "\n",

      "Review: Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. They're both the best of the best. This film marks the first time they worked together. I must say, I'm not a huge fan of war movies, but this one really sucked me in. The acting is great along with everything else and the DVD is very good for a single disc. Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors and he really made this film that much better. This is about the only violent movie I've seen that doesn't glorify violence. It shows the affects of war and impact it has on people and their families. This movie will soon be an American classic (if not already.) It pays a tribute to all those veterans who fought for our freedom, because freedom doesn't come free. This film should be viewed by anyone that calls themself an American.\n",

      "Review: The first 5 are not very funny, but good non the less. The 6th with him in the service is hilarious. Martha Raye in the first and third movie is wonderful. She is just amazing. Though, she is better in the first as an ugly duckling in love with someone whom she can't have, not knowing she is really in love with the someone helping her to get the one she can't have. Movies 4 and 5 have similar themes. They both take place in supposedly haunted out of the way house/castle. Both are good, just not very funny. There are racist overtones from the time period in both 5 and 6. Movie 5 has an african american actor you may recognize from a Charlie Chan film (not Birmingham Brown, but Chattanooga Brown played by Willie Best), he plays a controversial role and part, racist by todays' standards. Bob Hope lands in mud in the 6th and makes a racist(by todays' standards) joke.  I will update this after I have seen the rest of the films. Willie Best is in the 7th film as well. He is funny, but again stereotypical for African Americans by today's standards. The 7th film is a great film in which Bobs character bets 10 grand of someone else's money that he will not tell a lie for 24 hours. Well, of course the fun begins after that. The next 24 hours are filled with schemes, and foibles, and what not. It's a great film, I just wish that it was more politically correct. So far, the movies I have seen are good, but not so funny, but more like comedy/drama or dramady's films. The 8th represents what Bob Hope does best, the comical genius that is Bob Hope. Here is a spy thriller, comedy. Hope is accidentally dragged into a situation with a beautiful blond involving spies, microfilm, well you get the gist. He ends up wanted for a murder he did not commit, with spies all around trying to kill him. And then there's the penguin, part of his act on the stage he was performing on, when the spy entered his life. That penguin gets more laughs than Hope in this comedy. You see him in a tuxedo, pajamas, etc. If for no other reason, you should buy this set for this movie alone. The ninth was a true surprise, a true classic, and in color. The 9th is Paleface, yes you read this correctly, the original Paleface is in this set. In Paleface, Hope is a dentist from the east who gets caught up in a situation with Calamity Jane played by Jane Russel. The show is not only good, it's funny. This movie alone makes the set worth the price. The tenth and last movie has Hope with Lucille Ball, Hope plays a bookie and the title role. Here he is a money hungry person who cares for nothing but money. Enter a little girl into his life, add Lucy and you have quite a movie. And, who knew that Lucy could sing? I sure didn't. The movie is more of a dramedy than a comedy. Hope is out of place in this environment and just doesn't fit the role. Still all and all, the movie is a good entry into the set and enjoyable in it's own rite. Remember this set also has Paleface.  Imagine getting Paleface and 9 other Bob Hope movies for under $20, along with extras. What a bargain. All in All, I would say this set is a steal, but lets stay honest, stealing will get you into trouble. My advice buy it before the sellers realize what a gem they have and raise the price.\n",

      "Review: The ball bearings glide smoothly. The mounting brackets that attach to the table can be turned to face in or out. A nice backup if you suddenly realized that there's something on the way where you planned to screw it on. The length of the board you wanna install is only limited by the length of the table or your personal preference. I used a 3/4-inch, 4-foot melamine shelf board that I purchased at Home Depot for $10 then I asked them to cut it for me down to 36 inches. The melamine will chip on one side since the blade they use at home depot is meant for ripping. Mine didn't chip bad just because they just changed the blade when I got there. But no problem for me since I made the chipped side facing down. If you have you're own saw then I recommend that you use a 60-tooth blade. Or if you want your board to color-match your table then buy an unfinished wood then spray paint it.\n",
      "  If you measure as accurately as possible with some common sense, I don't see anyone going wrong with this product. Like any other slide, if not aligned properly, it can give you problems. Totally, not the fault of the manufacturer. The build quality, to me, seems heavy duty. It comes with 8 screws. Some of the holes on the mounts are oval, a very nice feature also for having some micro-adjustment options.\n",
      "  One room for improvement, IMHO is...I wish the screw mounts that go under the board extended more. The center of the hole is only 3/8 of an inch from the edge of the board your screwing down. It's just too close to the edge of the board for comfort. At least over 1/2\" would have been nice.\n",

      "Review: This is the 5th piece of Valor equipment that I have purchased.  The others being: the BD - 7 Power Rack with Lat Pull, CB-6 Adjustable Arm Curl Bench, DG-1 Stationary Bench, and the DA-6 Flat Bench. The quality of the equipment has been uniformly excellent and after several years of thrice-weekly use  no structural issues or vinyl tears. Ive been very pleased with the other Valor products.  The quality of this bench is no different but I should have done my homework.  First, it doesnt fit inside the Power Rack without removing the Racks Lat Pull  something I don't want to do.  I should have measured twice and bought once;  Second, it sits much higher than a standard bench.  This is due to the incline mechanism which requires more floor clearance.  That would be fine but now the Power Rack safety bars and bar supports adjustments are just far enough off that I need to raise the bench using scrap 2x4s.  Again, I should have measured twice and bought once; Third, stability.  Since it does adjust up and down and the seat moves also, its not as stable as a standard pressing bench  it wobbles a bit. Fourth, other reviewers have mentioned the narrowness of this bench and they are correct.  It is a bit narrow and when combined with its height, narrowness, and my 2X4s  well, it took a while to get used to.  Now, outside of the Rack it is excellent.  30 degree elevation is just about perfect for incline dumbbell presses.  Since it sits a bit higher, manhandling the dumbbells is easier.  At greater than 30 degrees elevation it is rock solid.  The wheels make it easy to move and handles near the head area and at the seat make it easy to move.  The bench is quality made.  If you're going to use it with a Rack  measure twice!\n",

I had completely stopped using the one from Schwinn because I could never get it to make a solid connection to my bike valve and it would let out too much air.  The one from Bell was okay but it let out some air too but didn't work as well with a schrader valve.  The bike pump is a huge upgrade and is made very well.  The base of the pump is extra large.  This gives you better stability especially if you are trying to air up a tube to a high pressure. It can start getting hard to pump so a larger base helps.  The pump has a large tire gauge with easy to read numbers that actually works. My other two pumps have it too but I could never get the tire gauge to work. I think its because air was being released.  With this pump I did not notice any air coming out and it was nice to know how much air I had in my tires with the tire gauge. The pump uses a unique T valve system which is the first time I have seen this.  It accepts both a schrader valve and a presta valve.  This is a big plus for me because I have a road bike that uses a presta valve and I also use a mountain bike that uses a schrader valve.  All you have to do is lock in to place by moving the lever to the correct side.  This bike comes in a very nice package and as a bonus comes with a tire repair kit and levers to take off tires and replace tubes.  It also includes patches for your tires as well.  Overall this is an excellent pump.  It's built very well and is easy to use and I recommend to anyone needing a pump. Please check out my video and pictures to take a closer look.  Please note that I did receive this pump at a discount in exchange for a honest review.  I hope you find this review helpful and thank you for reading.\n",

      "Review: I really like this screwdriver set.  The bits are well-suited for the task this type of tool is designed for yet the device is both sturdy and a bit larger than your typical precision screwdriver.  This makes the already tedious job of working with small screws a bit less cumbersome as you have more tool to hold on to without sacrificing the ability to manipulate even the tiniest screws.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do however question the wisdom of magnetizing these bits.  First, this is clearly designed for precision work which often includes computer and electronic device components.  Second, while the magnetic tip is a nice touch for removing screws, in my opinion it makes replacing screws more difficult.  Placing the screw on the tip and then guiding it into the hole is not always so simple when you start getting down into the single-millimeter screw sizes  - you iphone owners will know what i'm talking about i'm sure.  Placing the screw in place with forceps and then driving it in is quite difficult with a magnetized bit as the screw will pop out of place as soon as you get anywhere near it with the driver.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not a huge issue as you can still get what you need to get done after a few tries getting the screw in.  Me i simply demagnetized the tips as needed.

It's not 59 ft. Lbs but 29 ft. Lbs.  I e-mailed their tech support team when I seen different torques on forums and their u-tube video on installing these struts.  If you torque to 59 pounds they say the studs may snap or yield (stretch)!  Don't take my word for it contact their support team.  The only reason I bring this up is in a review someone mentioned they snapped a tower stud!\n",

Worked great as a breaker bar for the two large bolts.  Must take your time to fit new strut into fender well.  Yes it does fit just wiggle it around and find the sweet spot that will let it drop in.  Make sure the struts match each other bolt pattern at the top.  Look at the old one.  The top flange will turn with a large screwdriver between the studs.  I had to move my two struts about 1\" to match the bolt pattern of the old one.  TOOLS:  1/2\" drive rachet,  22mm socket, 22mm wrench or crescent wrench,  3/8\" rachet, 14mm, 15mm & 12mm socket, 5mm Allen wrench, 3/4\"-12\" long pipe nipple for leverage , a 1/2\" drive torqe wrench.

      "Also from time to time i use my AC drill, dremel, solder iron as well. At night i reduce the load to about 100-140Watts so i don't drain the batteries to hard as i don't have a wind turbine set up as yet. But if you're thinking of this set up you can't go wrong with Xantrex PROWatt as the sine wave is good during all loads e.g. (resistive inductive)\n",
      "The voltage seems to remain between 117-122 VAC, I've also tested the inverter to see if the low voltage BAT audible alarm did become active and further trips the inverter at 10.5 VDC protecting the battery bank from excessive drain, the overload also worked well likewise the over temp & GFCI protection as advertised.\n",
      "The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is due to the fan reving up at a voltages of 13.5-13.8 VDC under 200WATTS, the battery cable termination stud on the inverter is a mere 1/4'' and in my view it should be a minimum of 3/8'' as the power cables im using is a # 6-AWG six feet long with a 1/2'' hole on the copper lug, so attaching this to a 1/4'' stud i had to use a flat washer and lock washer\n",

      "\n",
      "  I easily give it the best rating ever for a fantasy adventure, BUT I and everyone else who saw the theatrical release waited far too long to see the complete story.  Christopher Lee's final scene as Saruman, which stunningly wraps up both the wizard's and Wormtongue's plotlines, is thrilling, shocking, excitingly filmed and utterly crucial to the plot and film.  In addition to wrapping up these narrative threads, the sequence even throws in a bit of \"Scouring of the Shire\", and actually does Tolkien one better, I think (I never liked Saruman's reduction to 'Sharkey', an ordinary thug, or his prosaic death in the original book).\n",
      "\n",
      "  Everything else, even the attachment between Eowym and Faramir, the breaking of Gandalf's staff and the Mouth of Sauron, could legitimately be considered non-crucial, although I'm glad to finally have them, especially the latter; I relish how Aragorn \"concludes negotiations\".\n",
      "\n",
      "  Besides feeling cheated, Lee must feel a sense of deja vu: in the last days of Hammer, he filmed \"To the Devil a Daughter\" (a much less successful adaptation of Dennis Wheatley than the far superior \"Devil Rides Out\")--and his entire death scene as the Satanist was cut!  Was Jackson feeling nostalgic for movies such as this, that don't even give their bad guys a proper comeuppance?\n",

      "  Whatever.  Mr. Lee, you're the best ever, whether in black cape, white robe or British tweeds, and I'm delighted there is a yet another revival of your film work.  Had it not been for Peter Jackson's lapse in judgment in the final theatrical cut, we'd have had it sooner.  Jackson deserves every buck his trilogy made, and every award it ever won, but if he ever puts Mr. Lee in a film again, I hope he'll give the devil his due.\n",

It was dropped at our front door in about 4 days and I did not pay for expidited shipping.  The shipping fee was nominal, the very funtional features and the low energy bill it requires to operate it made this the perfect purchase.  I wanted a freezer that was accessable from the front but only counter height, so as to access the built in cupboard, above the freezer, in our 1880 home.

For a sub-$100 bib, I think this is an excellent choice!\n",

      "Review: Dave Buzick (played by Adam Sandler) creates an incident during an airline flight and gets sentenced by a judge to anger management therapy. The therapist is Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), who the audience soon discovers is an egomaniac with issues of his own. There are wonderful cameos by several members of the therapy group, and Marisa Tomei is charming as Linda, Dave's long suffering girlfriend who is continually trying to improve his self esteem. We even have Rudy Guiliani and several members of the New York Yankees in crucial roles as guest stars.\n",
      "This movie has some truly hilarious moments, really comedic incidents and unexpected developments to keep the theatergoer interested. The idea was quite clever, and the cast is talented enough to pull it off. But neither the script or the direction lived up to the idea's promise. It had the potential to be five stars, but only rated as high as three stars because of the truly enjoyable last half hour and the very clever and quite cute surprise ending.\n",
      "Why was I so disappointed? The beginning was very contrived, and a lot of the supposedly funny situations early in the film were quite strained and unbelievable. Nicholson is superb within the limits of the script, and carries the early part of the movie with Sandler as his straight man. It also moved slowly on occasion, a serious problem for a comedy. Most disappointingly, a story with this much comic potential did not need the continued attempts at humor through sexual innuendo, crude jokes and generally off color material that occasionally was truly humorous but just as often contributed nothing of substance to the story and at times actually detracted from it. It seemed as if the scriptwriters often decided that it was easier to go for cheap laughs than make the effort to be really funny.\n",
      "So, if you like the stars of this film and want to laugh without having to exert any effort having to think deeply for a few hours, you will find this film a satisfactory diversion and will leave the theater smiling and feeling good about the conclusion and the truly funny sequences that did occur. But if your expectations are high and you want to think as well as laugh, then see BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM instead. It has humor, romance, a real story, sports and is incredibly well acted and directed.\n",

My preference in learning about various religious and spiritual faiths when it comes to the afterlife and heaven is what indirectly contributed to my interest in getting this dvd. Scott Eastwood plays Ian McCormack, a man born of religious parents who love him very much. Ian McCormack enjoys his life very much in New Zealand and enjoys hanging out with his friends and surfing. Ians parents seem to be supportive and understanding of his interests, but are concerned about his lack of spiritual faith. For Ian, everything seems fine and he is so passionate about surfing that he ends up successfully convincing his parents to allow him to go on a trip related to his surfing interests. My only caveat to the movie is that there were not enough scenes that I had hoped for when it came to depicting what he saw in the afterlife. However, in all fairness, The Perfect Wave was still pleasant to watch.\n",

My only negative about the case is that if you have a micro usb cable thats has thicker plastic around the plug, it won't fit into the port. I have normal cables (not the cable that came with the phone) that work with most every other case i've ever used for other phones (nexus 5, htc one m8, nexus 7, wireless headphones, etc) and they do not fit into the port on the phone.

One of the most appealing qualities of the Three Pines books is the wonderfully drawn rich character development in all the integral parts of the plot. If I had not read the book first I don't think I would have even understood what this movie was about.  I was very disappointed with the movie as I felt all of the characters were mere shadows of the books wonderfully full and rich eccentric villagers. Gamache is a fully drawn and deeply cerebral character that draws the reader in and keeps your interest peaked while inviting you to be his confidant.  Jean Guy has a deep platonic love for Gamache which was sadly missing from the movie and Nichol's tragic sneer was completely absent. Also absent was the wonderful acerbic, cranky Ruth, and our best friend Myrna who on a bad day could hold the whole village together was relegated to a token walk on role.  I was so looking forward to the possibility of seeing these wonderful characters step from the pages to the screen and it just didn't happen. Lets hope Louise Penny keeps writing.\n",

      "Review: In \"Electric Boogaloo\" director Mark Hartley, who loves movies, chronicles Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan, two immigrants who also loved movies, even ridiculous films with tiny budgets. I have seen a lot of the Golan-Globus and Cannon Films catalog, and never failed to enjoy these films, often in spite of their production values instead of them (\"Alien From L.A.\" anyone?) Cannon Films had a storied history that started small, exploded in quick order, overextended itself and came crashing back down to earth, closing its doors in 1994. But for a while in the 1980s Cannon reigned supreme and ended up making some extremely memorable films in several genres, most often involving derivative action plots, but occasionally venturing spectacularly out of the mold, perhaps most notoriously with \"The Apple\", an absurdist musical that Menahem directed and was completely convinced would be a huge hit.

      "Golan and Globus started stepping up their game by heavily popularizing ninja movies, some of which were better than others (\"Ninja 3: The Domination\" is unbelievably kooky, and decades ahead of its time starred a female ninja), and signing bigger actors to roles starting with Charles Bronson in \"Death Wish 2\". They also (unfortunately) helped start and popularize rap with movies like \"Breakin\", \"Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo\", and \"Rappin'\", which is a sort of sequel to \"Breakin' 2\". The first two films are heavily discussed in this documentary and some of the interviews are among the most amusing on display here. I am particularly thankful for the interviews with Michael Chambers (\"Boogaloo Shrimp\", who was truly amazing), and Adolfo Quinones (\"Shabba-Doo\"), which perfectly encapsulate the era.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other interviews are also great for different reasons: Bo Derek (who is still beautiful) discusses \"Bolero\", and Richard Kraft in particular is a hilarious commentator with a lot to say. After Bronson, Cannon went on to cast Chuck Norris and ultimately Sylvester Stallone, who they paid $12 million for \"Over The Top\", and action movie about an arm wrestling truck driver. These investments began to sour as their production costs skyrocketed (e.g. \"Superman 4\" which was an awful film with horrendous special effects and which ultimately bombed). Cannon's finances spiraled out of control: the SEC investigated them and Michael Milken the felon junk bond king raised $300 million for them among other signs that their empire was crumbling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stress became too much to bear and the Menahem and Yoram dissolved their partnership and started making movies competing with each other, starting with two atrocious Lambada movies (one of which was dedicated to the preservation of the rainforests!) The independent B-movie industry was forever changed by Cannon and their legacy lives on in production decisions even today. As one commentator noted: \"It's schlock, but they sure do make a lot of it\". Indeed they did, and it's glorious, just like this documentary.\n",

      "Review: As an actor, I think Joaquin Phoenix is flipping brilliant. And as a person, I think he -- like almost all people, and certainly most successful artists that our culture simultaneously idolizes and preys upon -- is infinitely more complex than we could ever hope to imagine. This isn't a movie, it's a cultural experiment; and in my opinion (whether we saw it or not) every single one of us flunked. Because the mere fact that we paid attention to this silly public persona, picked it apart, laughed, ridiculed, endlessly analyzed motivations -- that says all it needs to say about our relentless, ridiculous obsession with fame. The movie, the part that ended up on the screen, is utterly beside the point ... or at least, so personally relevant to Joaquin Phoenix alone (being swallowed up by a river, or a River) that our shallow \"connect-the-dots\" attempts are irrelevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I'm not giving the movie itself any rating. But Joaquin gets five stars, and I'd give him six or more if that were an option. For enduring the excruciatingly violent and public loss of such a caring and gifted older brother, at such a young age and in front of the whole prying world. For figuring out some way to not only go on, but to carve out a career characterized by roles of immense insight, grace, humor, and sensitivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't pretend to know the first thing about Joaquin Phoenix. But I know enough to realize that a loss of that magnitude irretrievably changes the course of a person's life; detonates and re-shapes entire aspects of a personality; prompts certain questions about the forces that fuel celebrity. To me, a book such as \"Last Night at the Viper Room\" and this movie -- they're tragic cultural companion pieces. Neither one reflects back anything even remotely flattering. And they're not intended to.\n",

So, I purchased this.  I have cooked with it once.  For the most part it seems good.  My only complaint is you can see that the enamel inside was sprayed on cast iron that was not as smooth as I would like.  I don't mean rough in general all the way across, I mean hear and there are small bumps of cast iron that were not ground down before coating with enamel.

I ordered several cases for my Galaxy S6 Edge and while I did like the quality of most of the cases, I ended up getting some for the S6 even though I don't own the S6!  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and said it was maybe my fault and explained to them that I was in the hospital for almost 3 weeks and that I just wanted to exchange the S6 cases for the Edge cases.  They wrote me back saying that they will not be doing any exchanges and that they don't honor things like this when you buy their cases at promo prices....???  REALLY??  So I have spent almost $200 on cases for all of my devices in the last several years but they can't do me a simple favor for one time?  Well, they just probably lost a very loyal customer and I am upset by the fact that they give so many of these cases away for free to people that review them but when it comes to a paying customer I just don't count unless I paid full retail...  I own 11 devices and buy and sell and trade all the time so I guess they made it easy for me to recommend other brands in the future.  By the way, this specific case is way too tight and it scratched my S6 Edge so I would not recommend THIS specific case anyways, but they do make some very nice cases just wish customer service could have helped me out.  Oh well, you live and learn and I don't have time to get upset about a company that can't go out of their way to make an exception for a loyal customer.\n",

      "First off, when I wanted to purge the steamer wand, the black plastic part fell of and into the hot water inside the pitcher. One has to screw the little metal tip onto the metal wand, then stoop the black plastic spout over the wand. There is nothing to hold it, just a little tight fit.  I stopped operations to put it back on, pushing it all the way up to make sure it had been placed correctly, but it slipped off again, and it did this for another two times, after which I gave up on this feature. Fail.\n",
      "I cannot imagine to have to fish the plastic tip out of the frothed milk each time I want some of that. My suggestion would be to make a tip with a little mechanism (screw end?) to hold it onto the metal tube.\n",
      "Next: The coffee puck after brewing is so soupy it is a total mess. And it does not happen once, but each and every time. I ran six cups of espresso, and each time, I had a swampy coffee puck to take care of. Disposing it with a cup underneath, because I really don't like it to drip all over my kitchen floor, all the way to the sink! Fail. Don't know what to tell the manufacturer how to fix this one.\n",
      "Next: After I brewed two cups of espresso, I realized that my machine was standing in a small puddle of water around its base. I investigated this and realized that the bottom catch box was overflowing and spilling water onto the countertop.\n",
      "I emptied that out, cleaned up the mess, and started another cycle of brewing two cups. And again, the bottom drawer was overflowing. When the cycle of brewing is done, one can hear gargling inside the machine, like water running off somewhere. And it ends up in the bottom catch box, which overflows after two cups brewed.\n",
      "I would like to suggest to make the excess water run back into the tank, and not out to overflow the catch drawer. It is messy and inconvenient. All the more, because I buy spring water in bottles and this machine makes me waste half the bottled water with this annoying overflow system. Not a good thing.\n",
      "The only redeeming aspect is that it does brew a fair cup of espresso, with a nice foam head. The flavor is not as good as in the Delonghi which I had before, but I'd give it a B.\n",

      "Review: When one thinks of New Zealand film making, one probably assumes that it was Peter Jackson that put them on the map - that he could be the only filmmaker out of that region.  Alas, one should realize that New Zealand has been releasing films for many years, and have even put their stamp on American cinema as well.  I recently had the opportunity to watch a little film that probably wouldn't attract too much attention today, but in 1985the rumor is that it was the second highest grossing foreign film in our country.  One can only applaud New Zealand for their creative effort, and for me, I will be applauding them for more.  \"The Quiet Earth\" was a fresh slice of science fiction delight.  It was a unique premise, based of a bestselling New Zealand book, that has seen several transformations in American cinema throughout the years.  Most recently I witnessed a mediocre adaptation in the film \"The Last Man\", but must express my excitement more towards this film due in part to the ability to grow the characters, the attention to detail, and expressionism of the unknown.  \"The Quiet Earth\" is one of those films that interweave religion, science, and human existence together so well that it will leave you lapping for more by the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be brief, \"The Quiet Earth\" poses the question of what emotions one would feel if discovered they were the last man on the planet.  Would it be the hypothetical \"kid in the candy shop\" experience, or be driven to  the brink of madness due to boredom, or would one invest time in ones self - rediscovering why, who, and how the world transformed into the desolate Earth it became?  All great questions that are explored greatly by director Geoff Murphy and demonstrated through the ingenious acting abilities of one Bruno Lawrence.  It would be tough to handle the first act of a film solo, using no language outside of the sheer insanity of being alone, he gracefully pulls it of with ease.  In fact, it was the beginning act of this film that immediately grabbed me.  I could watch Zac (Bruno) over and over again as he engulfs himself in his new environment.  Just as we think we are about to loose him, others are brought into the picture, not as confusion, but as a moment of hope and inspiration.  While they seem threatening, Zac learns what he must do to ensure that they survive to rebirth the Earth - leaving us with an ending that makes us glad to have such a thought provoking genre.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not want to use this as a platform to compare and contrast this miraculous film and that of \"The Last Man\", though it was through the latter film that I was introduced to this one.  They are two separate films, and I will leave it as that.  \"The Quiet Earth\" will evoke laughter, tears, and at times, the genuine scare tactic to bring about the story.  Director Murphy does what I thought only Danny Boyle could have done in \"28 Days Later\" with empty streets, unpopulated towns, and streets as urban mazes.  While the tricks are simple, the effect is tremendous.  Again, I cannot state the Bruno Lawrence is amazing, both alone as well as his interaction with the others as they arrive.  Instead of focusing on lust, insecurity, and neediness,  he continues with his research to find a cure for the effect that he, or his team, may have brought to the world.  The concept of death playing a big part of their existence now is mind-challenging.  It really places a different perspective on \"where\" these survivors really are.  Is it the Earth that they once knew, or some parallel universe as seen in \"Sliders\"?  Then, just as you think you know the answer, Murphy throws in the final moments of the film and any guesses that you may have are out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cinematography, besides what I said above, is amazing.  It really captures the film, and for the 80s budget pre-CGI, I have to applaud this team.  While listening to the commentary, the effects were done with no budget, but with imagination - something you find lacking when computers become too much of a staple to the film (ie see the newer \"Star Wars\" films).  The acting, as already said, is 1980s acting.  Sometimes wooden, sometimes stagnet, but overall exactly what I wanted from this film.  It fit the tone and  low-budget-y of the film, but it was perfect.  This is what I miss from films that were released in the 80s.  Sure, they didn't have the money, but they were creative and imaginative - a crucial feature I miss in today's cinema.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I must admit, that this is a film that will definitely be added to my collection.  It is one that I can watch time and time again, continually questioning the facts, the unknowns, and the opportunities.  Don't be afraid of 80s foreign films - they may surprise you ... greatly!\n",

      "Review: I'm usually not too much into foreign films. I decided to watch this one since one of my favorite actresses, Julie Delpy (who enraptured me in \"Before Sunrise\") was in it.  I must admit, the first time I  watched this movie, I was like \"what the hell...?\"  However, the  more I thought about what I saw, the more I understood.  A lot of this  movie is very subtle.  I've seen reviews claiming it's a dark comedy, but I  don't see what's funny about this film (I didn't laugh a single time).  But  that's not the point; even without understanding the humor, I could see the  raw emotion that drives this movie.  I've heard a lot of people rave  about the final scene in this movie, and they should.  It's the GREATEST,  most heart-wrenching, emotional, poignant scene in the HISTORY of motion  picture!  I had to rewind the tape because I didn't understand Delpy's  \"sign language\" the first time.  However, once I did, it just  touched me in a way no that other movie scene ever has.  To people who will  watch this movie for the first time; watch the last scene with all your  attention!  You'll be richly rewarded!  One last thing; WARNING, this  is not a happy movie.  Don't be fooled by critics claiming it's a  \"comedy\".  It's an incredibly sad and poignant movie.\n",

      "Review: I ordered two boxes of these from Vitacost, and my family was pleasantly surprised.  Some gluten free products have been not so well received, but everyone in the house loves them.  If you like the flavor of a cheese-it, you'll love these.  They are thin, crisp with a great cheese flavor.\n",

      "We'll never truly know, but the film is a peppy cavalcade of big name stars playing big name stars. It's a character-heavy motion picture so let's discuss the impersonations.\n",

      "Dunst is the flavour of the month, she makes Davies look like an attractively complex figure. While reflecting the verve of a young privileged woman at an exciting time, she maintains a moral core without really being certain of precisely what she wants, which rings true.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flamboyant Eddie Izzard was a surprise in the cast but made an atypically understated Chaplin. You see the intelligence and yearning in his eyes, the sly wit dripping from his casual tilts of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, I felt these two were the only admirable actors in the film. The rest of the crew members acted as though they were in a much dopier movie. Herrmann for instance plays Hearst, the big tycoon, as a buffoon channeled through Bill Murray, huffing and puffing when he feels betrayed, grinning goofily and almost cross-eyed when he appears giddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The film overall is a very watchable one though, particularly if you can overlook a needlessly sepia tone across the board giving a pseudo-noir look. The idea clearly was less to weave a murder mystery yarn and more to splice together the interactions among people at the scene of a high-society and thus hush-hush crime.\n",

      "Review: I love this original scone mix.  It's excellent tasting just plain, but what I really like is using it as a base for making every other kind of scone.  Add in some blueberries and cinnamon for wonderful blueberry scones.  One of my favorite savory scones just needs chopped olives and rosemary.  There are many many numerous combinations that can be added to this original mix-- whatever suits you fancy for that occasion.  If you have trouble with how much to add, just use a receipt and add the \"extras\" to this original mix!!  Fresh ingredients added to this original mix makes them so much yummier!!  Best mix around!!\n",

      "Review: I've only used it three times, but the bag has performed well so far. The coldest weather I've been out in was about 35 degrees. I was toasty warm inside with a liner, long underwear, and a pad underneath. I'm pretty sure I would be fine down to 20 degrees or maybe a little less under those circumstances. The only problem I had was getting the last foot or so of the zipper to close. I had to sort of roll over onto my right side to take the pressure off to get it all the way up. I'm right at 6' tall, and I was concerned about whether the regular would fit me OK, but it does. Anybody much more than 6' should definitely go for the long.\n",

      "Weight-wise, this isn't bad for the price. I weighed it inside my compression sack and got 3 lbs, 9 oz., so the listed weight is right on. The only real issue I have is the size. For car camping, it's not an issue, but for backpacking, this takes up an awful lot of space in my pack. I use a waterproof Sea-to-Summit MEDIUM eVent compression bag, and it just BARELY fits into the bag, and then into the sleeping bag compartment of my pack. The compressed size is about 14\" long by 9.5\" in diameter, and it takes me 3-5 minutes to get it stuffed down to this size because it's such a tight fit in the bag. I wouldn't want to have to do that every morning on a long trip. I find that between this and my 1.5-person tent (which also isn't particularly small) I'm really pressed for space in my 65L pack even on an overnight trip. I think this works well as a starter bag given the price. I really couldn't justify spending hundreds of dollars on a bag initially, but if I get more serious about backpacking I'll probably upgrade to something a bit lighter, and especially more compressible.\n",

      "- The film quality may not please some persnickety movie collectors, but it seems to me to be a clean new issue and I am so glad to be able finally to obtain a copy of this rather peculiar oevre.  Enjoyable as a visual version of Kafka's novel and for lovers of the absurd and surreal.\n",

I AM A DISABLED VET AND I HAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE GETTING AROUND IN DOING MOST ANYTHING IN THE KITCHEN, THUS IT IS EASY FOR ME TO HEAT THE PACKAGE IN SIMMERING WATER TO BRING THE FOOD TO THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE AND EASY FOR ME TO GET THE FOOD ONTO A DISH AND ENJOY A FILLING AND SATISFYING MEAL.WHEN I WAS ON ACTIVE DUTY MANY YEARS AGO I NEVER MINDED HAVING ONLY RATIONS AS I KNEW THEY WERE MADE WELL AND NUTRITIOUS.NOW I FIND THEM TO BE JUST VERY CONVENIENT ALSO.\n",
      "- Just installed it today to be used as a floodlight. It is very well made with a heavy metal housing and \"GLASS\" lens that won't fade or haze like plastic headlights or change color. It is constructed in two pieces that make mounting on a wall very easy. The rear section mounts to the wall or post and the front section that contains the LED panel. 1/4 in. thick large aluminum heat sinking panel and glass lens is supported on two vertical posts on the left side. This supports the front panel in an open position to make wiring connections an easy task without having to hold the heavy front section.\n",

In fact it contains more sugar, sodium, and additional \"natural flavors\" than my preferred brand! I don't like hidden ingredients and deceiption advertisement. I will not purchase Naked's Coconut Water again and am not interested in any other Naked products as they have lost my trust.\n",

      "- Hollywood Hotel has plenty of action--and terrific swing music especially with Benny Goodman and His Band in tow! The plot moves along pretty quickly although they could have edited out some footage; at times the plot has too many complications. The acting is very convincing with the exception of Mabel Todd who plays Dot Marshall, the kid sister of famous Hollywood actress Mona Marshall (Lola Lane). Mabel overacts and director Busby Berkeley should have told her to tone it down; watching Mabel do the role of Dot Marshall gets on my nerves. On the other hand the cinematography is excellent and the choreography works very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the action starts, we get that remarkably famous, timeless ode to Tinsel Town entitled \"Hooray For Hollywood\" performed by Benny Goodman, his band and some musicians who were born to ham it up by belting out this tune! We quickly discover that the band is at the airport to give a send-off to their saxophone player Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell). Ronnie has a ten week contract with All Star Studios in Hollywood and although Ronnie doubts he'll reach stardom he's pretty excited anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once in Hollywood, however, things don't go so well for poor Ronnie. The big Hollywood star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) is frantically planning her big appearance that night at the Hollywood premiere of her latest picture with co-star Alexander DuPrey (Alan Mowbray), but when Mona finds out that she has lost the coveted role in the upcoming movie production of \"Bitter Night\" she throws a huge tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere. All Star Studio head 'B.L.' Faulkin (Grant Mitchell) tries to convince Mona that she's too good for \"Bitter Night\" but Mona boycotts the premiere. The studio itself panics and hires a Mona Marshall look-alike named Virginia Stanton (Rosemary Lane) to pose as Mona Marshall--and then they hand-pick Ronnie to escort the person he thinks is Mona Marshall to the premiere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ronnie becomes smitten with \"Mona,\" who is, of course, really Virginia; and they begin a romance that gets complicated by misunderstandings and more. Eventually, at least some things gets straightened out even though Mona has them both banned from All Star Studios.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other things can go wrong; and so the plot can go anywhere from here. Ronnie finds work as a singing waiter at a drive-in coffee shop; but when a director at All Star wants Ronnie to dub songs for Alexander DuPrey there could be trouble and heavy politics if Mona ever finds out that Ronnie is back at All Star. How did Mona get her way about having Ronnie banned from All Star in the first place? Moreover, what happens when Virginia poses as Mona, picks up DuPrey at his home and takes him in her car supposedly to the Hollywood Hotel for a radio show appearance? What about \"Fuzzy\" (Ted Healy), the man Ronnie hires to be his agent--will \"Fuzzy\" do a good job and get Ronnie work? Watch the movie and find out!\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the best moments in the picture come when we are treated to seeing Benny Goodman and His Band perform both at the beginning and closer to the end of the picture. They do a rousing rendition of \"Sing Sing Sing\" and Frances Langford appears as a singer for Raymond Paige and His Orchestra. Great! Louella Parsons plays herself in this film. The other songs, including \"I'm A Fish Out Of Water,\" are generally quite sweet and they come throughout the film.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DVD comes with a few extras. We get a Porky Pig cartoon and another bonus feature that has some vaudeville act footage. There's also am extra bonus that features Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Hollywood Hotel is a fine motion picture that suffers a bit from too much going on at once. I think Warner Brothers wanted to turn out a wild, jam packed full of action film with well written, snappy lines but they overdid it; the plot suffers from an occasional manic spell every once in a while. It remains one of the better films from this era, though, and I do recommend it for fans of the actors in this film and director Busby Berkeley.\n",
      "- Marshall Fine writes, \"Hughes's writing is never as sharp as it should be and this film winds up being only intermittently humorous.\"  Marshall Fine is obviously an idiot.  Scene for scene, character after character, this is a flawless comedy.  I watch this film every year and it never grows old. I would love to know what Marshall Fine considers \"funny\".  Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is a perfect movie.\n",
      "- The movie musical \"Nine\" is an insult to the genius of Federico Fellini and that of  Tommy Tune. The Broadway musical is based on Fellini's film \"Eight and a Half\" which deals with  the director's movie-making block in the 1960's. He went to a spa to recuperate and began to envision a thrilling confessional style. The title came from the fact that he had just finished his eighth film and couldn't decide what his ninth film would be about. Tommy Tune adapted the film for Broadway using the health spa as his only set. The musical showed all the women in his mind and what they had meant to him and alas what he did to them. Fellini let us see his guilt and where it came from. Tommy Tune and Maury Yeston made it sing. It was a phenomenal experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I heard that Rob Marshall was considering making a film version of the show, I was concerned because the score is not one of Broadway's best and that the dramatic intent of the score would not come across on screen. I also thought that Marshall is not yet the great film maker that Fellini was and could in no way come up to the Maestro's standards. I was proven right. I was so dismayed that Marshall set in the film on a movie set and not in a spa. This is very indicative of Marshall whose style is rather cartoonish and bombastic as evidenced in his film version of \"Chicago\" which razzle-dazzled itself into caricature rather than the deadly satire that was Fosse's vision so beautifully recreated in Walter Bobby's Broadway revival. Federico Fellini was a master at combining the subtle with the grotesque. His choice of the spa gave him the freedom to move from the everyday to the realm of the protagonist's dreams and memories. The clean white walls of the spa were blank canvases on which Fellini was able to take his audience into the mind and heart of Guido's nervous breakdown. We were given nothing of Daniel Day-Lewis' inner conflict--just running up and down staircases and scowling at the camera. Who was this man for whom women suffered? Marshall had no idea. But then Marshall has trouble capturing the nuances of his male characters. For example, Richard Gere, who is a fine subtle actor was nothing but a cardboard character in \"Chicago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the three main women in \"Nine\" they are symbols of three facets of women. Kidman is the ice queen. Cruz was the whore; Coitilard the long-suffering wife. With his ending of \"Nine\" Marshall would have us think that these women are Fellini's inspiration, but they are only his instruments upon which he plays his songs. Fellini had much more to film than just some little romance, which seems to be what Daniel Day-Lewis was working on at the end of \"Nine\" the movie. Fellini never made a little romance--his vision was epic. Marshall's is myopic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, when the \"Nine\" news came out, I thought Marshall was making a bad decision. He just isn't equipped with subtlety. I wish he had chosen Sondheim's \"Follies\" which is certainly more in his range with great parts for women and cold, torn men. I do think given the right material Marshall can be one of our great directors. Hey, Rob, go back to Broadway and direct a few little plays. Trust the material first and out it will come mastering of your craft.\n",

      "One last note: I hope I never see another musical number in which scantily clad women sing and dance around a chair. Let Bob Fosse rest in peace!!\n",
      "- After filming 1932's STRANGE INTERLUDE with Clark Gable, Shearer would take an almost two year break from making movies. She would return to play one more pre-code enforced \"modern woman\" role in the the classic movie...\n",
      "\n",
      "RIPTIDE (1934)\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is yet another film of Shearers that is full of great sexy, \"pre-code enforced\" fun in the same vein as other great Shearer roles such as STRANGERS MAY KISS(1931), THEIR OWN DESIRE (1929) and THE DIVORCE (1930).\n",
      "\n",
      "In RIPTIDE, Shearer is a notorious New York party girl who meets a stuffy but romantic British Lord played by Herbert Marshall while on their way to a costume party. They fall for each other immediately and have a whirlwind romance. When it comes time for Marshall to leave for England, he decides that he can't leave Shearer and proposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "He takes her to England with him and they marry. Several years go by, they have a child and Marshall grows more distant. A bored Shearer takes up a friends offer to go to a party in Cannes. There she runs into old playboy friend Montgomery. After years of being cooped up with Marshall, Shearer lets loose with Montgomery and pushes the line of \"platonic\" but stays faithful to Marshall.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a scandal sheet photographer takes a picture of Shearer and Montgomery, Shearers husband is outraged. Considering her past, he refuses to believe her innocence. They break up and Marshall is intent on divorce. Realizing this...Shearer really does cross the line with Montgomery, rather blatantly so. Marshall meanwhile has changed his mind and tells Shearer that he wants her back. Shearer begs Montgomery not to tell her husband about their affair, but news gets out and this time Marshall really does divorce Shearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "However... this is far from the end for Shearer and Marshall and the movie doesn't end as you might expect. This one is directed by Edmund Goulding who directed a couple other famous soap opera classics, DARK VICTORY and GRAND HOTEL.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shearer wears some wonderfully revealing outfits. She has without a doubt some of the greatest \"bare shoulders\" that these aged eyes have ever seen. Again...Shearer is able to pull off the unconventional, scandalous, sexy vixen while still being the fun, cute, witty girl next door.  The cinematography is lovely and the interior set design is also well done.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a shame that this would be the last of the sexy, indapendent party girl roles that Shearer would play. It would have been interesting to see her take the \"independent, fun loving woman\" role to another, more mature level. However, this would be the last role of that kind. After RIPTIDE, Shearer would be relegated to roles as put upon housewives and period pieces. Roles in which she was likable, but just didn't seem very at home in.\n",
      "- As a long time fan of James Arness I was thrilled to find this on Amazon.  As retired/newly hired lawman Jim McClain there is so much of Marshall Dillon in the character.  Always fighting for justice.  After watching him play Marshall Dillon on Gunsmoke for 20 years it's a little weird watching him in a different role but he's still wonderful to watch.\n",

      "- \"White Christmas\" opened in The Big Apple's (New York's) Radio City Music Hall in 1954 to record breaking crowds.  With Irving Berlin's music and the song \"White Christmas\" already a huge success, this show was sure to be a winner!  An unprecedented 6 weeks of rehearsal time was granted for making the movie before even shooting it, which ensured it's perfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The movie displays the superb singing and acting talents of super-crooner Bing Crosby, the multitalented singing, dancing, comedy talents of the extraordinary and unsurpassed Danny Kaye, the beautiful melodic voice and wonderful acting talents of Rosemary Clooney, and the sensational dancing and acting talents of Vera Ellen.  Danny and Vera danced and sang their way through this movie together as a couple.  What a talent combo!  It should be noted that the sensational Vera Ellen only went on to make one more movie in 1957 before she retired from the silver screen.  Also note that Vera is the only one whose singing voice was dubbed in because it was said that she couldn't sing, but she sure could dance enough to make up for it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Paramount's famous designer Edith Head designed the costumes for the movie and the girls' gowns and dance costumes are absolutely stunning!  Even the guys look great.  You'll notice Danny Kaye with a grey-blue suit, with matching socks and shoes in a dance number that really accent an extension of the movement of his whole body all the way down to his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The show begins on Christmas Eve, in Germany, 1944.  In the midst of airplane gunfire and bombs falling from the sky, a USO-type show put on by Army Captain Bob Wallace (Bing) and Private Phil Davis (Danny) attempts to entertain their troop.  Their commander is General Waverly, a Major General (a 2-star general), a really nice guy and they absolutely love him.  Right after the show, Davis hurts his arm pushing Wallace out of way and milks it every time he wants something from Wallace.  Davis uses the \"how I hurt my arm saving your life\" routine to get Wallace to include him in his show act after he gets out of the war and all through the picture. Hence, the act name \"Wallace and Davis\".\n",
      "\n",
      "As Wallace and Davis are getting very well known in show biz, they meet the 2 sisters of an old army friend. You only see the guy's photo but I think it's a grown-up Alfalfa from the Little Rascals.  The Hanes sisters are Betty (Rosemary) and Judy (Vera) Hanes.  You first see them doing an act \"Sisters\" and the show soon takes a turn toward match-making.  Davis and Judy decide to \"help\" Wallace and Betty get together.  Davis figures that if he gets Wallace interested in a woman, Davis can have some down-time for himself.\n",

They are surprised to see no snow AND the Inn owned by their friend, the now retired General Waverly.

      "\n",
      "The movie has TONS of great songs, sung by everyone except Vera.  Vera gets a few notes in here and there, but, they are someone else's voice dubbed in.  Songs include \"Sisters,\" \"White Christmas,\" Counting Your Blessings,\" \"The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing,\" (Song and dance), \"Snow,\" \"Mandy, There's A Minister Handy,\" \"Gee I Wish I Was Back in the Army,\" and \"Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On a side note, the song \"Sisters\" brings back fond memories for me.  A friend, Karen, and I worked together on the Training Staff for about 10 years and we had gotten to be really close friends, like sisters.  Like most people today, we were overworked and underpaid.  Whenever things got stressful at work, we would sometimes pop out of our cubicles, go arm in arm, and sing a few bars from that song.  It always lightened up everybody's' load for a couple of minutes.  So, whenever I hear that song, I always think of Karen. I'm sure the movie will trigger some memories for some of you, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "On another side note, you may notice George Chakiris in the dance scenes.  He was seen as a supporting dancer in many movies before appearing in \"West Side Story\".  An interview with Rosemary Clooney from 2000 is also included in the special features.\n",

      "Can't imagine there is anybody on planet earth who has NOT seen this movie unless they have been in a coma since 1954 but just in case, this movie is absolutely FANTASTIC!

      "- Back in 1954, director Michael Curtiz (1886-1962, who won the Oscar for Best Director for the 1942 film \"Casablanca\") directed a musical that has become a beloved Yuletide classic for many people (myself included): \"White Christmas\".  With the all-star cast of Bing Crosby (1903-1977), Danny Kay (1913-1987), Rosemary Clooney (1928-2002), Vera Ellen (1921-1981) and Mary Wickes (1910-1995), the film is often regarded as an updated remake of the 1942 classic \"Holiday Inn\", which also starred Bing Crosby and featured the same classic Yuletide song, \"White Christmas\".  Though the two films do have many similarities (they're both musicals with lots of song and dance and they both have two main male characters), there are sufficient differences in their respective plots to make each film a unique viewing experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"White Christmas\" begins on a World War II battlefield with soldiers performing a Christmas show for their fellow soldiers.  The two starring soldiers are Bob Wallace (Bing Crosby) and Phil Davis (Danny Kaye).  During the performance, all of the soldiers in attendance pay homage to their commander, General Thomas F. Waverly (Dean Jagger).  The film then moves forward to its present day of 1954 where it finds Wallace & Davis as being very popular and successful on-stage song & dance performers.  After one of their performances, they go to a nightclub where they a performance by two beautiful sisters: Betty Haynes (Rosemary Clooney) and Judy Haynes (Vera Ellen).  Bob & Phil become infatuated with the pair (Phil more than Bob).  They meet each other and Phil sneakily arranges for himself and Bob to go to Vermont, where the Haynes sisters are going, instead of their planned destination for their next performance.  Bob isn't too happy initially with Phil's subterfuge, but relents and enjoys the trip with the Haynes sisters to the Vermont ski lodge.  Sadly, when they arrive, there isn't any snow; but they quickly discover who owns the ski lodge: their former commander, the retired General Thomas F. Waverly, who is assisted by his daughter Anne Waverly (Anne Whitfield) and Emma Allen (Mary Wickes).  The unfortunate lack of snow isn't very good for the ski lodges business, but Bob & Phil decide to help the retired general in the best way that they know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Songs by Irving Berlin in \"White Christmas\" include many wonderful and catchy tunes as listed below.  (Vera Ellen's singing was dubbed by Trudy Stevens.)\n",
      "\n",

      "\"White Christmas\" has deservedly become an annual Yuletide classic that will be enjoyed by many generations to come.  Overall, I rate the film with 5 out of 5 stars.  Also on the DVD is an excellent commentary by Rosemary Clooney.  Sadly, \"White Christmas\" was Vera Ellen's second-to-last film after she decided to retire from acting.\n",
      "- WHITE CHRISTMAS remains the all-time classic Christmas movie (not counting IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE).  Featuring a fantastic cast and a superb Irving Berlin score, it's a heartwarming and lavish musical.\n",
      "Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye play two ex-GI's who team up with a sister act (Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen) and help out their old army general (Dean Jagger) whose Vermont ski lodge has hit hard times.  They decide to write a new musical and premiere it at the lodge with hopes of going to Broadway.\n",
      "The performances cannot be bettered; Bing and Rosemary make a delightful singing screen couple; while Kaye and Vera-Ellen make the perfect matchmakers heckling on the sideline.  Mary Wickes (SISTER ACT, NOW VOYAGER) is hilarious as Jagger's busybody other half.\n",
      "Clooney is given the fantastic number \"Love You Didn't Do Right By Me\", Crosby is affecting in his duet with Clooney \"Count Your Blessings Instead Of Sheep\", Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen bring down the house with \"The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing\" and Vera-Ellen is breathtaking dancing to \"Mandy\".\n",
      "The DVD includes an audio commentary from Rosemary Clooney, a retrospective interview with Rosemary Clooney and trailers.\n",
      "- After the Beatles made it big with \"A Hard Day's Night\" and \"Help\", there were a slew of copycat movies cranked out by the music industry. \"Ghost Goes Gear\" is one such attempt to capitalize on the success of Beatlemania.\n",
      "To be perfectly honest, I didn't want to like this film. Overall, I thought it was Monkees-lite. And any attempt at sticking with a storyline goes out the window about twenty minutes in. This is unfortunate, because the film would be far more memorable if the slick madcap weirdness of the opening segments could have been maintained. However, I wound up thinking the movie wasn't half-bad, for what it was.\n",
      "Some have criticized the director, Hugh Gladwish, for letting the plot get lost, but I think he did pretty good with the rest of it. Visually, the film has some minor flair. The camera motion is reserved, yet fluid when called for. And I was struck by how sharp the focus was throughout the whole film. I also liked the Monkees-ish drum chase down the river in the opening segment, and the umbrella-march to Rowthorpe Hall. The Spencer Davis Group isn't too bad at Monkee-like mugging for the camera. The lads are pleasant enough, and do their best. The ghost is kind of funny, too. There is even a touch of Python in the proceedings.\n",
      "Two personalities stand out in the rest of the cast; Jack Haig will be instantly recognizable to fans of the Britcom \"'Allo, 'Allo!\" And Nicholas Parsons is interesting as the uptight band manager, sort of a cross between John Cleese and Paul Lynde.\n",
      "The audio commentary is more about the music scene in England at the time of the film, rather than about the film itself. This commentary was enjoyable, though, and informative. Spencer Davis and humorist Martin Lewis readily joke that the film was a black hole for just about everyone career-wise.\n",
      "The Spencer Davis Group is not bad at cooking up the groovy tunes. The other acts are instantly forgettable, save for the Paramount Jazz Band which seems rediculously out of place in the movie (the commentary explains that, in reality, the jazz band fits for the era). And Dave Berry is just plain annoying with his weird, hide-his-face foolishness. Thank goodness he only has two songs!\n",
      "The Three Belles are an odd act, too. As Spencer and Martin Lewis remark in the commentary, they appear to be the inspiration for Austin Powers' Femmbots. In their first number, look for the middle Belle, who is the only one who seems to know how to react to the camera. One gets the sense that the producers just lined up whoever was available, but not bigger than the Spencer Davis Group.\n",
      "Of course, Stevie Winwood fans will want to see the film, but he really doesn't do much acting-wise. Spencer and Peter York do most of the work there.\n",
      "There's no naughtiness whatsoever, so you don't have to worry if your kids want to watch it (not that it will hold their attention past when the \"gear\" concert starts).\n",
      "This slice of the Sixties British Invasion will undoubtedly be more interesting if you're into the Spencer Davis Group or the era, but the movie really holds more significance for the British audience than for anyone in the US.\n",

      "The problem with the Coen Brothers is that in every one of their movies, they're looking through a glass half empty and never half full. 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is no exception. Oh yes, you'll find the usual excellent cinematography, casting, acting, direction and neat recreation of bygone eras. But what you'll never find is sympathy for your protagonist. The Coen Brothers always pride themselves on standing above the fray and looking down on their anti-heroes. In essence, what they're saying is, 'we're good at exposing the underbelly of the dark side of Americana; applaud us.'\n",

      "The failed folk artist, Llewyn Davis, is prototypical of their one dimensional view of things. Are there really people like the fictional Davis (supposedly an amalgam of real life musicians including Dave Van Ronk, Phil Ochs and Ramblin' Jack Elliott)? People so clueless, so narcissistic, that they never listen to feedback from anyone else, so that they never change. It's a rare individual who is so misanthropic, like the Coens' Llewyn, that you will ever run into him, in real life. But even if there is such a character, does he really deserve to be immortalized in film? I hardly think so.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Coen brothers had no problem in admitting that 'Inside Llewyn Davis' has little plot. More important is the fact that the story is devoid of a concrete antagonist. The only antagonist is Llewyn's internal demon-- which takes the form of myopia, cluelessness, and narcissism. The demon never emerges into Llewyn's consciousness, so that perhaps he can reflect upon where he is going wrong. Instead, we're asked to sit through a 104 minute chronicle of an unlikeable mediocrity, who pursues a wrong-headed quest for fame and fortune in the folk music world of the early 60s.\n",

      "Llewyn Davis is much more caricature than a real human being. The Coen brothers go out of their way to show just how much of a loser this guy is. Are there really people like this? Consider their catalogue of Llewyn's shortcomings: He originally was part of a Simon & Garfunkel precursor type group, Tom & Jerry, but his partner committed suicide; he has no money and sleeps on acquaintances' couches; he's forced to carry some friends' cat around with him after he locks himself out of their apartment; he impregnates a woman but doesn't have to pay for the abortion, after he learns from the abortion doctor, that a previous girlfriend, never went through with the procedure; he drives all the way to Chicago, only to learn that a music manager never received his latest record in the mail and doesn't think he has any commercial potential; he heckles a woman during a folk concert and is later beaten up badly by the woman's husband, outside in a dark alley.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Inside Llewyn Davis' is the ultimate sad sack tale. And unfortunately, sad sacks never make for good drama. What the film does have is lots of atmosphere. There are some neat cinematic scenes, notably the one involving John Goodman as a sleazy, heroin-addicted jazz musician, who is a passenger along with Llewyn, on that trip to Chicago. I also liked the attempt to recreate NYC in 1961, particularly various streets in Greenwich Village.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather than consulting all the positive reviews from 'professional' critics on Metacritic, you'll find some much more honest and insightful reviews in the review section of IMDb. There, at least, is a sense that Llewyn Davis is not a believable character and if by chance, such misanthropes truly exist in real life, their journeys are certainly not worth being looked at, given the lack of change or growth. If you like a straw man, Llewyn Davis is for you. The Coen brothers are experts at shooting straw men down--but such a maneuver should never bring praise and accolades; that's reserved only for the gullible!\n",

      "Cluster 3 sample reviews:\n",
      "- Emma has never been my favourite Jane Austen novel.  I tried to read it, but I couldn't get into it.  I've seen a number of adaptations, but I found them (mostly) boring.  I have trouble keeping all the characters straight, especially since some of them have taken different names (Frank Churchill is actually Mr. Weston's son, for example).  When I started watching this, I was as confused as ever.  But I kept watching, hoping that I would be able to get everything straight in my head.  By the time PBS aired the last of the three parts, I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good casting, fine scenery, and gorgeous costumes are things I've come to expect from BBC productions of classic works, and Emma didn't disappoint.  After seeing this beautiful adaptation, I may have to rethink putting Emma at the bottom of my list of favourite classic stories.\n",
      "- Emma Thompson continues to astound me with her talent. Not only is she one of the greatest actresses working today, the woman can also write! And write well she does. Jane Austen is a frightfully difficult mountain to tackle for even the most experienced of screewriters, and Thompson conquers this feat with the adroitness of an learned professional. (Her Academy Award shows others thought so too)\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma Thompson plays Elinor Dashwood, a practical-minded young lady who spends most of her energy looking after her two sisters and mother, which unfortunately gets in the way of her marrying. Kate Winslet plays Marianne Dashwood, a passionate lively young woman who isn't afraid of showing her love to anyone. Alan Rickman also delights as the staid Colonel Brandon (oh my god, his voice...) and Hugh Grant is appropriately 'English' as the bumbling Mr. Ferrars with whom Elinor falls in love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Particularly dazzingly performances from Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet, though their youngest sister, little Margaret, also gives a memorable performance as a spunky, geography-minded girl. All in all, a remarkable film and one to purchase and watch over and over again.\n",
      "- I did not realize it was in French, however I did enjoy the movie.  I thought it realistic and the acting, especially by the lead character Adele, was very good.  First love is always tough for the novice, let alone realizing you're gay.  It's a little long (3 hrs.) but you get to know Adele better.  They say 1 is the loneliest number, but that 2 can be as bad as 1 - so I believe this is the case ultimately with Adele.  Her immaturity and starry-eye love for Emma results in unsatisfactory consequences.  You may not like the film but it is thought provoking at the very least.  In my opinion, Emma was never really in love with her - hence the feeling of isolation by Adele.  The film cannot be compared to Elena Undone which is my #1 favorite concerning the subject matter.  It's apples and oranges.  One is about seasoned, matured adults (read ROMANTIC) whereas this film is about a very young girl facing her attraction to women and falling in love with a young but experienced female.  I differ in opinion with a friend who felt the sex scenes a little raw.  I disagreed and said get over it and remember when you were much, much younger!!!  Both have lovely bodies and the sex scenes are explicit.  After all it is what two women do sexually.  I would have preferred more sensuality and affectionate verbalizing, but you can't have everything bundled up into one package.  Otherwise, direct it yourself!!\n",
      "- I'm a big fan of just about anything BBC, many Canadian series and films, and some of the more old fashioned series and films such as Downtown Abbey, Poirot, Mulder, etc ... While this wasn't BBC or Canadian, it has a more old fashioned feel. If you like these types of shows as well, this might appeal to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the movie, \"Woman Wanted\", directed brilliantly directed by Keifer Sutherland (who also plays the son, Wendall), Holly Hunter  plays Emma, and Michael Moriarty plays Wendell's father, Richard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma answers an ad for a \"Woman Wanted for housekeeping duties ... \". Emma answers the ad by phone, speaking with the owner of a big old home, Dr Richard Goddard. Goddard reveals that the home, is occupied by himself, as well as his 20-something year old son, Wendell. He tells Emma the home needs to be put in order, which is why he's seeking a live-in housekeeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "During one of their easrly conversations, Emma revrals to Richard that she was previously married to an actor, who left her a man. Despite the fact that Emma's been abandoned by a man she truly loved, she decides to move on with her life, instead of becoming \"a statistic\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma is highly energetic, pulling the old house together rather quickly with a lot of cleaning, some no-nosense boundaries, and wonderful cooking skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendall and Richard both become enamored of Emma. However, Wendell is highly immature, and initially ruffles Emma's feathers. Richard, who is a professor, is a very well-spoken and engaging man. Albeit quite a bit older than Emma, they seem to be a good match.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma is a lovely woman, young, devout, honest, caring, and beautiful. It's easy to see why they both fall for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendell resents his father because he feels his father never loved his mother, who was manic-depressive, i.e. bi-polar, and sick for much of their marriage.  Richard had her committed to a sanatorium, which is where she died, and Wendell never forgives his father for that, or his subsequent abandonment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendell, who's in his late 20's, seems to be stuck at a younger age, often acting out with fits of temper (which he calls \"seizures\") when he doesn't get his way.  It looks as if Wendell might have inherited his mother's illness to some degree.  Initially, Emma can't seem to say or do anything right, but she's tough, not backing down when Wendell behaves badly.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's another housekeeper who comes once  week, Lydia. An older woman who tells Emma she \"doesn'ts bends\", meaning she can't get down to mop floors. Apparently, Lydia has been with the family a long time because he informs Emma that he loves Lydia, so she better get along with her .. but not in a terribly polite manner. Emma tells him she's ignoring his rude and uncalled for comments - she has no preconceived notions regarding Lydia.  There's another housekeeper next door who quickly befriends Emma ... I can't remember her name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendell runs around in shorts, shirts, and sweater vests, which exemplifies his immaturity, while Richard's manner is kind, caring, and highly communicative with Emma. Richard quickly falls in love with Emma, and she with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendell, who's also in love with Emma runs off to his girlfriend, Monica, and marries her in a fit after Emma reads his poetry, and doesn't respond the way Wendell wants or expects. When he returns with his new wife, Monica, he tells her she's not allowed in his room, he can't cohabitate because that's where he writes. Monica is highly distraught at not being allowed in Wendell's room, Wendell retreating to his room, and not speaking with anyone. The two quickly get an annulment after Wendell admits to Richard and Emma that he's in love with Emma.  After his pronouncement, Richard and Emma tell Wendell they're in love - which, of course, sends Wendell into another fit, but he recovers quickly as Emma sets out to help him become published.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a sublime, somewhat dark portrayal of two very different and separate people - the scholarly father and immature son, who are brought together by a beautiful young woman who cares deeply for both of them, and works to try to bring them together. Things don't go as planned, and the circumstances that unhinge the relationships, bring an unexpected joy for Emma, who ends up in another place without Richard or Wendell.\n",
      "\n",
      "I LOVE Holly Hunter and would watch just about anything she plays a part in. I also like Kiefer Sutherland, who really hit my radar after watching 24. Michael Moriarty, who I've always enjoyed watching, and has been a part of SO MANY really wonderful movies and TV series. Some of the TV series include:  The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes - which I LOVE, as well as Law & Order, The Librarians, and The New Outer Limits.  He has SO many movie credits, some of which include: Report to the Commissioner - an excellent action packed film. Pale Rider with Clint Eastwood.  Inglorious Basterds - a brilliant film if you like WWII &/or have a disdain for Nazi war crimes.  Neighbors with John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Tino Insana - who looks a wee bit like William Shatner, & Cathy Moriarty, no relation from what I've gleaned. Jarhead with Jake Gyllenhall , Soapdish with Sally Field and Kevin Kline,  Matin&eacute;e with John Goodman and Cathy Moriarty, Kindergarten Cop with Arnold Schwarzenegger,  Suspect Zero with Ben Kingsley, The Boost with James Woods and Sean Young, and Courage Under Fire with Denzel Washington and Meg Ryan.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a good film. Probably not for everyone, but if you enjoy the actors in his movie, you might enjoy \"Woman Wanted\".\n",
      "- The Emma Thompson version is not so good = so many details/characters left out.\n",
      " Col Brandon is awful. Edward & Charlotte, also.\n",
      " I finished the book then watched the movie.\n",
      "If a viewer didn't know the story I would think they'd have questions.\n",

The material of place-mats is vinyl which is good regarding the cleaning purpose.  Just clean with water or a cleaner wipes and you are done. Also vinyl will last long and is very durable to daily ware and tare. Food stains does not remain on in. I love the shades of red it comes with- red,maroon and burgundy. I like every thing about this set plus the bonus 6 pk coasters. I would have given it five stars if the coasters would have been in matching shades of red just as place-mats. The coasters are on brighter side of red shade where as the place-mats are on duller side. Other than that everything works. Place-mats looks exactly like the picture. I will continue using it. Received for free or at discounted price for a fair and unbiased opinion. All statements made are my own and are honest.\n",

      "Review: I've had problems with faucet protectors from most hardware stores because they aren't deep enough.  This one is 5\" deep, plus another 1/2\" of foam glued on.  The opening is 4\" x 5\".  This unit comes with the new easy-to-use fastener -- not the old wing nut style.  Just slide the latch up to the cover and you're done in seconds.  I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the hoop that fastens over the faucet is a little small.  Many newer homes, like mine, come with anti-backflow valves permanently attached.  The loop on this one just barely rolled onto that fitting and I'm wondering how many years it will last from being stretched so much when attaching and removing.\n",

In our household that translates to four people being able to finish it with once pass around the table. So, if you have a large gathering, you will want to have several packets.

      "Review: The pink on this is just like the pictures itself. It looks nice and bright and is very pretty. I bought this case because I thought it was very cute. It looks just like the pictures when I opened it up and received it. I was very satisfied with the look and the true colors. I also love the white boarders very much and gives it a nice clean look. The case itself is nice and thin and not bulky which is what I wanted. It says jelly, but I wouldn't say that but more of a soft rubber flexible feel. Even though it's a nice thin case, it still does a great job at protecting the outside of my phone. The boarders go all around the edges and comes over as well to get that nice added protection. Nice looking and a very simple case without having too much going on is a plus.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review. There isn't much I can say about this case just the fact that it is super cute and I do receive a lot of compliments on it whenever I have it on my phone. It protects my phone overall and does a good job with that and looking sleek!\n",

I especially like the understated red led on the switch. It shows when the light is on (as if you wouldn't know) without lighting up the truck cab. The light itself is very bright and I like the flood/spot combination. With this light on it makes the headlights look like old flashlights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Someone asked if it would fit in the bumper space on a 2013 F150. Someone replied that it will fit. That's not exactly correct - it can be MADE to fit. The light itself is too wide to fit in the bumper space. If you then add the width of the supplied mounting brackets it is even wider. Also, those brackets won't work due to the fact they are unidirectional (they have to turn outward, not inward when mounting). I did mount mine in the bumper space (photo 1). However, I had to make my own mounting brackets (photo 2) and had to trim the inside edges of the plastic bumper pads to fit around the ends of the light. If you're wanting to go with a \"no cut\" fit, you'll need to find a 20 inch light or a 20.5 inch that doesn't mount to the sides.\n",

There was not enough difference between the low and high brightness, so at night when the tail lights were on and you hit the brakes it was barely brighter.

      "In the pictures and video the left light is the LUYED light and the right is the old 1157 incandescent bulb. I also have an LED 3rd light bar so you can tell which still is with just the lights and which with the brakes (when the center bar is lit). You can see in the pictures that the basic tail light on level is a bit brighter than stock, which is actually good. The other photo with the brakes pressed you can see the brightness is pretty much the same. In the video you can see that when I hit the brakes it is obvious, as well as the faster response of the LED.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing that is misleading is the specs for the brightness. These are not really 800 Lumens, as that is a measure of the light across all wavelengths, and these only put out perfect red light. Compared to the Bulbeats, these look really dim to the naked eye. But put them, into a tail light housing with a red lens in front and they look the same or brighter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another advantage of these over the others is that they are red LEDs instead of white. Since they are shining through a red lens, the bright white LEDs actually look at bit orange. You can't tell in these pictures and video, but the LED is a nice, deep red color.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason you should get these over the Bulbeats is that you can easily tell that the brakes are on, and that is the main reason for having brake lights.

      "Review: FINALLY Surefire got with the programs and created a 18650 compatible light. If I recall they tried their proprietary systems in the past without a lot of luck. I own about 24 flashlights or so lost count. This is my 6th Surefire. I swore them off in the past in favor of much better value vs cost lights from fenix and 4sevens. I still think they are awesome value. Even 10 dollar ultra fire lights with good batteries have worked well.  It is those exact oversize batteries I've used for years that will fit this Surefire, surprisingly since they are oversize 18650. Orbtronic Japanese made Panasonic Lithium batteries 3400 mAh, vs the 2600 this sure fire comes with.  The beam is typically Surefire on this light, excellent. The color is better than the Chinese lights I hace. I think the dual mode version is more practical for majority of users; versus the momentary on light. Those who need the momentary on know why its not a clickie or dual mode. The fact this light comes with a car and household compatible charger is why I dropped the hammer and purchased it. That means in an grid down you can still charge this light and its solar compatible with proper equipment.  I've read the springs can bind a bit on the tac model, more so than the dual mode.  By design of the rear switch and the slightly longer length of the 18650 batteries. The dual mode version has about 1/8\" longer tail cap.  Overall I'm very pleased with this light and its versatility of dual battery compatibility along with dual source compatible charger. Charger seems of very good quality. The springs that keep pressure on batteries are very smooth unlike most 18650 chargers.  As I stated before I recommend the dual mode for more utilitarian and daily use, that with a 2-4 pack of Orbtronic 18650s and you are set. I've not tried the sure fire charger on the Orbtronic batteriss yet but foresee no issues. I'll post of I have any issues.\n",

      "Review: Watching the second season of \"Dark Angel\" knowing that the show would be cancelled it becomes easier to see that there the fundamental dynamic of the series was just changed way too much.  After all, gone is John Savage's villainous Lydeker, who had at least a proprietary interest in the transgenics.  In his place is a Snidley Whiplash type, Agent White (Martin Cummins), who wants to kill all the transgenics, not so much because of orders from the government but because of a much larger ancient conspiracy (e.g, \"Exposure\") having to do with the whole eugenics vs. transgenics argument (pretend there is one).  Instead of the super-soliders from the X-5 series trying to blend in with humanity and avoid being killed by their creators, we know have transgenics of every description, which far too often becomes a \"freak\" of the week.  While in the case of Joshua (Kevin Durand), the first transgenic, this has some nice payoffs, the rest of it is just becomes a bit much and you need a program to keep all the transgenic clear in your mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there is the whole romantic relationship between Max (Jessica Alba) and Logan (Michael Weatherly), which starts off the second season with him thinking she is dead.  Then he gets the good news, she is alive, but the bad news: she has been given a virus that is genetically programmed to kill Eyes Only.  You have to admit, it terms of keeping apart two people who seriously want to get together, this is a rather creative way, and there are a couple of very good episodes dealing with their romantic problems (e.g., \"Borrowed Time,\" \"Hello, Goodbye\").  We are supposed to then throw X-5 Alex (Jensen Ackles) into the mix as a love triangle, but I can never believe Sam would be unfaithful to Logan, let along want to go the kissing cousin route.  I prefer the problems with the X-6s (\"Bag 'Em\") and the X-7s (\"Designate This\").\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the best proof of how the show was matching steps forwards with step backwards is in the supporting cast.  With Alex and Joshua becoming the third and fourth most important characters in the show after Max and Logan, that meant reduced roles for Original Cindy (Valarie Rae Miller) and Norman (J.C. MacKenzie).  The latter is reduced to on-going homoerotic shtick with Alex, especially in the Manty Coro bits, and the former is reduced to popping in to episodes for brief moments of clear thinking and moral support.  This is underscore by their return to prominence in the series finale, \"Freak Nation\" (raise your hand if the final scene reminds you of a line from CSN&Y's \"Deja Vu\").\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the problems with Season 2 of \"Dark Angel\" is that making things bigger and going the whole \"X-Men\" route with the public outcry to get the wicked mutants, is just pretty much a complete flip on the more intimate and secretive world of post-Pulse Seattle we got in Season 1 (and if you listen to the commentary track for \"Freak Nation\" you can learn what further changes were coming in Season 3).  It seems strange to fault a show for moving in new directions, given how often they become stagnant, but all these changes might just have been too much too soon.  Then again, the fault might be audiences were not particularly open to so many changes.  You certainly cannot say that watching Alba as Max got tiresome (just her comic book refusal to ever kill any of the homicidal maniacs after her and her buddies).\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironically, FOX's reasoning for cancelling \"Dark Angel\" was that they did not want to do two futuristic science-fiction shows (i.e., costly sets and special effects), and decided to go with the highly anticipated sci-fi western \"Firefly\" from \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" creator Joss Whedon.  Of course, \"Firefly\" never had the ratings of \"Dark Angel\" and never made it to double figures on aired episodes.  If you missed \"Dark Angel,\" then it is certainly worthwhile checking it out on DVD.  The second season is not as good as the first, but still way above average in terms of science fiction shows.  James Cameron directed the finale, which marked the first (and so far only) time he has dealt with human actors as a director since \"Titanic.\"  The DVD also includes some featurettes and a gag reel, but the chief attraction in the extras are the few but definitely above average commentary tracks.\n",

      "Review: It's a haunted house story, so you know, there's only so much that can be done. And it all is. I was quite surprised at this venture as King is famous for very slowly building up tension. Rose Red is one of the very few things he's done that opens with a bang, slows down a bit as we get to know the characters and the environ, and then just doesn't stop. As I live in Europe, I never saw the mini-series, but rented the double DVD which is some five and a half hours long. I watched the entire thing from beginning to end three times and just bought it. I think it is the best SK production to date. Not the best script or story, that stays with The Stand, but the best production. The story is, I think, a bit lame, but so what? It's a haunted house story, it's aim is to scare us, and it works quite well on that level. The DVD, at least the one available in Europe, is a good one, with a pseudo-documentary of the history of Rose Red as well as a documentary of the building of the sets, which are really fabulous. It's just great fun, well-acted (well, Julian Sands!) and very well produced, the house itself is great eye-candy, and, it even has a bit of a moral imperative.\n",
      "No question, The Haunting of Hill House is THE haunted house movie, as I'm sure even Stephen King would agree. (And we can see the Hill House influences on Rose Red) But that doesn't mean that this one isn't very good as well.\n",
      "(Oh yeah, why not five stars rather than four? Just because I think the actual story, which I will not divulge, is lame. But still, the film has everything else going for it, so I won't begrudge Mr. King yet another story with no foundation and no explanation.)\n",

      "Review: Growing up as a kid in the 1970s, my siblings and I always looked forward to Sunday nights when we would gather in front of our TV set and watch our favorite foreign shows on Channel 7 one after the other. It started with The Muppet Show at 6pm, Donny and Marie, Mork and Mindy, Charlie's Angels and, finally, Three's Company.\n",
      "Having complete sets of Three's Company and Charlie's Angels, it was, therefore, such a joy to finally learn that Donny and Marie would finally be released on DVD. Inspite of the fact that this DVD set was advertised as \"Volume 1\" I still bought the DVD because, for me, owning this set was still better than none. Viewing the 4 select episodes with my mom last weekend (like we did 30 years ago) was a nostalgic event. We enjoyed seeing Donny and Marie all over again at their prime singing, acting and dancing their hearts out. I also still clearly recall their wonderful performance of \"Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing\" which was thankfully included in Episode 2 of this set so seeing this performance all over again was pure joy. After viewing the 4 episodes on 2 discs, (I got this DVD together with Season 6 of Golden Girls), I wanted more! I felt really disappointed that for 4 episodes, I had to pay $20.00+ which, when compared to the $27.99 cost of the Golden Girls Season 6 containing 21 episodes, was really a rip-off. It would have been such a great buy if this set was called \"Donny and Marie: The Complete First Season\" containing ALL episodes. When will we see that day? I am sure the manufacturers of this set had their reasons for releasing such an incomplete set but to fans like us, there is just no excuse for depriving us of the joy in seeing the complete first season and the next 3 seasons! I appeal to the people behind this set to please release the complete 4 seasons because I assure you of our complete support in purchasing the sets. The Donny and Marie Show deserves to be seen again and again by our generation and future generations as well because this show was simply brilliant and is a shining example of what great entertainment is all about. I would rate this 5-stars if it was the complete first season but due to incompleteness, I rate it only 3-stars.\n",
